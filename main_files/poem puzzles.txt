In this affair

A ticking clock
Unecessary spot

Arteries slashed with sword
Veins rushing forward

Scarlet blush
an incessant touch.

-------------------------------

say you have 3 plates, "whimsical," "mortiferous," and a blank one

Worthless working, waggery wind
Arrogant ambition without animastic abstersion.
Muliebrity! Masculinity! Anticipating man's morality.
Would women's      words wem?
(mortiferous)

The trick is that, while the player thinks an M word must be between the last line, it's really blank because the beginning of the poem starts with W and there is no 'conjunction' word to put in there.


-------------------------------

What can you say
as blood fills up the mind?

Whatever you do
I'll make your empty soul die
