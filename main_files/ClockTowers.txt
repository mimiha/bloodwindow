oh man I had this awesome dream about a dungeon, they're these two clock towers in a bigass courtyard with a HUGE underground complex, the only way to get in is to go in these gates called the king & queen gates

the king's gate is seen at plain view and is attached to the right clock tower. the queen's gate however is actually underwater in the "moat" of the courtyard, below the left tower. you have to pull some lever underwater to drain the "moat," but that lever actually opens the king's gate instead of the queen's gate.

The lever has to be held in place; once let go, it automatically starts refilling the moat and closes the king's gate.

The Queen's gate is actually opened by a switch in the king's gate. 

After opening the Queen's gate, your partner can dive and get into there without having to wait for the person who went into the King's gate. However, because no one is holding the lever, the King's gate will be closed. The person in the Queen's gate has to find a rope that can tie the lever to a hook next to it to permanently drain the moat and open the King's gate, all while the person still in the king's gate finds their way back to the entrance.

After both teammates are back at the courtyard, they can both enter the queen's gate and finally go further by doing puzzles that needed both of them to continue. What's left now is just a series of interconnecting gates between the king's gate and the queen's gate underground, leading to places you couldn't go in the king's gate and vice versa.

Just a very complex maze.
