                Blood Window


=================Original plot.....=======================
	A beautiful girl lies underneath. Her real name is Chloe. she has always had serious psychopath mental issues, and has dreamed of killing people since she was young. She just loves death. She was born with pure grey hair and strange red eyes; the pupil is just a straight line across the iris.
	When she was six, a boy stole her pencil and accidentally stabbed her with it. She went blind and the eye turned pale blue. She was so in rage that she stalked the boy home and killed him. She didn't use a weapon, but a new psychic power that formed after she turned blind...
	After this happened, she began to assume she was God and she could do anything, so she started killing other classmates who made fun of her or made her angry. When she was 7, one of her victim's brothers raped Chloe (details below).
	Because her body was still not fully developed, her estrogen count was too low and the testosterone level overrid. Her feminine traits were not very noticable, and her voice grew deep. She dropped out of 7th grade and ran away, and pretended to be a man from then on.
	Now living on the streets, she tattooed herself and stole drugs from Waterline Hospital. She spiked her hair and renamed herself as "Felix". She also stole her own motorcycle, and not only steals from Waterline but she deals drugs to others too. She loves syringes. She uses double machine guns and lives right next to Waterline, in a small, abandoned appartment.
 	Chloe abused her new power so much that it caught the eye of local scientists. They started to search for her and wanted to find her secret power. She is constantly being chased by the scientists, and doesn't get caught until she meets Tenko.
	Chloe tattooed blue streaks running from her eyes to the end of her face to symbolize tears. Because after she got her psychic power, she only can cry blood.

              FELIX/CHLOE || フィリックス
==========================================================
	Felix does actually not exist. He is only a creation made by Ruofl who is influenced by Ruofl and Chloe's thoughts, though he would be considered Chloe as her body turned into him. Ruofl and Chloe can both take over his body, but once the eye disappears, and he loses Ruofl, his body reverts to Chloe. Ruofl made a bargain with Chloe before she inherited his eye: in order to live, she herself must die because women aren't allowed to inherit the power. instead, ruofl will bear a child within her body, which will be mostly influenced by chloe, but will also be influenced by ruofl. chloe accepted because she did not want to permanently die. however, felix is his own self. After he realizes that Chloe is still apart of him, he can freely transform into a girl and back.

Chloe has a twin brother, Alexander (They call him 'Wound', chloe's family name is Wound)
the family didn't have enough money to support both so they argued which one to send to adoption. the mother wanted a boy, the father wanted a girl. the father argued his way through it and won chloe. the mother was forced to put Alex under adoption.
chloe grew up with a cold mother but a warm father, so after her father died it was the end. her mother constantly told her that she wasn't wanted and etc... and she never knew about her brother.

her brother grew up to be a doctor and work in the hospital ... with Doctor. One of the cardinals, Tenko's father, Cardinal Paine, is the entirity behind the eye plot...

	Felix was smart enough to not use her psychic powers in school. When she entered middle school, she was ridiculed by mostly everyone. 
	The eye is called the Blood Window because when it is used, the blood will spew out of the eye. It changes any fluid coming from the eyes, so people who cry blood have the Blood Window.


	One of Chloe's memories contained in Felix is her rape scene. She missed her bus ride home so she decided to walk home because she knew her mother would not help her. so she begins to walk home but she gets lost. a young tenko (14 or 15) stumbles by and sees the girl looks lost. due to his helpful nature he asks her if she's lost. She says yes, and he asks where she's going. She says her address and tenko leads the way. "my name's tenko, whats yours?" "chloe," she says. "cool," tenko says. 
	She gets lost though, after she trips when he turns a corner and she doesnt know where he went. He said theyre almost there so they ran ahead but chloe trips. then a man comes up to her and asks her,
"are you alone, little girl?"
"well, i-i was with a boy but he disappeared..." 
"come here, I've got to show you something"
	she follows and you can hear Tenko calling in the background "chloe, chloe, where are you?"
"hey, i can hear him.. sorry i have to go"
the man grabs her by the throat and chokes her, "ahh stop!" tenko comes in and sees this and he gasps.
	chloe looks at tenko and whispers his name before he throws her to the wall and knocks her unconscious, but before then she whispers 'why...'
	tenko tries to stop the  man but he aims a gun while bending down preparing to take off his pants and says 'do you want to interfere with me, little boy?' he says nothing and runs off in terror. the man then rapes chloe while tenko runs off...
==============FELIX FACTS
-Chloe has scars on her hands from slicing her hands to lick the blood, due to ruofl's vampiric nature
-She also has a strange attraction to the dead.
-If Felix gets too emotional, the chaotic side takes ahold of him and immediately splinters everything around him - tables, walls, pots, everything. This is a side effect of having Ruofl.
-When she is a zombie, she reveals her psychically controlled hands, the reason she has telekinesis. She has a total of 6 invisible hands that are situated on the edge of her fingers. They are extremely sensitive to being touched, and will lash out and attack by themselves if not controlled by psychic power. Their power and range are only limited by the psychic himself.
-Felix always closes his eyes when he plays Stefano's Song on the violin.
-When Felix is a man, he has much more aggression and less sympathy.
-When Felix is a woman, she is a little more passive and becomes more empathetic and loving. She's still a crazy motherfucker who wields knives, though.
-Whenever Felix throws knives, he throws them in such a way that the shape creates a heart.
-Felix has two bars, a blood level bar and a regular mp bar. the blood level bar is for his psychic attacks. If it gets lower than 25%, Felix will become sluggish and his capabilities will be halved. If it reaches zero, he will pass out.

                      TENKO
==========================================================
	A year later, tenko's mother and him are together and they get ganged by dudes. he remembers what happened and he tries to stick up for his mom but he almost gets killed, and they cut his mother up and cut off her head.
	However, the father (who is a cardinal of the church that commanded psephis), actually planned this so he could make tenko a psephis since before the mother rejected. The father is a good friend of the doctor's and the doctor told him of the myth, then he worked on the side of evil alongside the doctor.. the doctor had promised him fortune and the world to him if he could help him. The reason why he made tenko a psephis is to do the dirty work for the father, and then kill tenko off later on. 
==============TENKO FACTS
-Tenko is psychotically overprotective.





==========================================================
-Plot
	There is a Greek philosphy of the "Blood Window". Only the blind can get this eye, and whether you get it or not is predetermined by fate. It is a blind, blue eye that can cause destruction and death as long as the blind eye is not damaged.
	This era is of the Industrial Revolution. The blind are discriminated to all hell because everyone wants that special eye. The story takes places in a large city, where the northern half are rich and the southern half is impoverished and full of bloodshed. Tenko lives in the upperhalf of the city, with the sect of St. Morning as a monk. He is a "Psephis", St. Morning's Soldiers of God. The Psephis has a bad reputation because they are like the Spanish Inquisition. They live to extinguish foul criminals and the like.
	Recently, there have been several cases of a serial killer that kills only girls. The Psephis are currently on this case. Tenko is told to deliver a package to St. Avril to help minimize the casualties from the serial killer, and he should keep his eye out for the killer.
	He makes his way through and stops at a convinience store and is robbed by Felix. He steals the box and runs off. Tenko is left to try to track down Felix. He talks to people in the area and finds out that Felix lives next to Waterline. But when he goes there, all he sees is a trail of blood. He follows it to his destination, St. Avril - and watches as Felix is about to get killed by the scientists (he is wearing a blinder for "some odd reason"). Tenko jumps in and roundhouse kicks the doctors to the face and saves Felix, only for the sake of the package.
	Felix explains there were bombs in the package. Tenko is surprised at why they would deliver bombs to St. Avril. Felix is punched by tenko and he runs away. He returns to St Morning. On the way there, he witnesses another one of the victims of the serial killer, who only kills girls that have their stomachs exposed. He sighs and heads on, and finds Felix having a conversation with the bishop...
=================BEGIN SCRIPT====================
"What have you stumbled upon st. morning for?"
"Don't play dumb, you git," she says sitting back in her chair. "you know what i'm here for."
"I don't understand," the bishop says.
"How cliche." she sits up in her chair. "First off--"
"Stop!" Tenko yells. They both turn around.
"Y-you..." Felix growls. She aims her gun at him.
"Now now, stop it, both of you," the bishop says. "Stop this pointless fighting. Tenko, I see you're back. Please have a seat with us."
	Felix lowers her gun and sits back down. Tenko has a seat. They glare.
"Anyways, as I was saying before this git came in, you don't have to play dumb - you keep sending psephis to my house... so sod off."
"I think you have a mistake," the bishop says, losing his cool. "We are the soldiers of god. we would never send our psephi to attack people."
"....How cliche. Right." she says, glaring. "So why do people, dressed the same as this bloke over here, constantly come to my house and try to kill me? Why do those same people go to others' houses and kill them? You fail to realize your little secret of being the next Spanish Inquisition is already out."
	Silence.
"I see," says the bishop. "I think we need to speak alone. Tenko, will you leave the room?"
	He stands to get up but Felix slams her hands on the table.
"No, god damn it, this bloke WON'T leave the room. Guys like him in your psephis parade are blind to the fact that you arent killing people just because you think they're "HERETICS". You have a different motive, and I don't know what it is, but it certainly isn't heresy. Once you involve me... you're taking a step on land where you shouldn't be treading on. Bastard!"
"You..." Tenko growls.
	She stands up.
"I heard you think I'm the devil."
	The bishop stares, then begins to chuckle.
"Oh Mr. Felix." he says. "Tenko, step out for a moment."
	Felix says nothing this time. Tenko does so, and closes the door. The bishop stands up. and locks the door, then 	returns to his position.
"We are the honourable psephi," the bishop says with a smirk. "We are known for exterminating heretics that are a threat to us. You might have found our secret, but there is more to it than you think. This is how we found the very special you."
"I'm not amused," Felix says. "But do continue."
	The bishop walks over to a bookcase.
"After hearing of constant thefts and murders near our precious Waterline, some of our representatives told us of the existence of you. This is when the serial killer came about, the one who only murders girls."
"So you bastards are up to something in Waterline, huh?" Felix glares. "I'm not surprised."
"You fail to realize, dear Felix, you're an Astral Carrier ..."
	The bishop pulls out a gun and aims it at Felix.
"And your power will be all mine!!!"
"How cliche," Felix growls. "Sorry, but NO!!!"
	The Bishop shoots, but Felix defends himself with a psychic wall. The gun's bullet deflects off.
"Ah, using your power to create a barrier..." The bishop chuckles, "You're quite crafty for a puppet!"
"Look, I don't know what you're talking about" -- Felix releases the barrier -- "But you're getting on. my. nerves! And when you're on Felix's nerves..."
	He makes the bookcase fall on the bishop. He also grabs the lights off of the ceiling and throws them at the bishop, 	creating a fire and setting the bishop on fire. He screams in agony and tenko tries to open the door but it's locked.
	Felix extinguishes it before it gets too big, and lifts the bookcase up. A writhing, burnt bishop lies there. As a 	final blow, she rips his limbs off.
	She smiles.
"...Felix won't show you mercy." She walks over to him, and bends down.
"Do you understand now?" she asks. "Your filthy lies only lead to your demise. I only do things for myself in this disgusting world."
	She unlocks the door.
"Well, you're free to do whatever. I'll be looking for stuff in this cathedral."
	She walks away. Tenko comes into the room and gasps at a dying bishop.
"Tenko...ten..ko." the bishop cries softly to him.
"Bishop Gregory," Tenko says softly. He kneels.
"You are an honourable psephis..." he bishop says. "Don't let... that devil get away."
	The bishop dies.
"Yes..." Tenko says.
=================================================
Tenko leaves the room of the dead bishop and tries to find felix. He's standing around looking at the library in the other hallway. Tenko confronts him in anger and says he'll avenge the bishop and he'll protect psephis pride. felix turns around and sees kooters running at him with high speed fist-in-his-face. Felix creates a psywall, but kooters is so strong he breaks through it and delivers a devistating punch to felix's face. he flies into the wall. at the same time tenko holds his fist in pain, it's bleeding through the gloves. "What ...what was that? it was much harder and more painful than a human skull... almost like i was hitting a wall made out of diamonds..."
	Felix is lying there with a bleeding and bruised face thinking in shock "What the fuck?! A man so strong to break through my wall...??!!! is a psephis really that powerful...?" She gets up and stares at him with disbelief. Tenko is still shaking his hand in pain. "Ow, that stings!" he says. He shakes it again, and then gets ready to take another punch at felix but shes staring at him. Tenko makes eye contact but then doubles over from the effects.
=================BEGIN SCRIPT====================
"Who...are you?" Felix says, enraptured by his eyes.
	Tenko is kneeling on the floor.
He says in anger, "My name is Tenko... and I'm.. going to.. DESTROY YOU!!!.."
	He falls over clutching his stomach in pain. He vomits on the floor.
"You must know!" Felix cries out, "You have to! You have them, too! Don't you!"
	She clutches her heart.
"It's why I get this feeling from looking into your eyes," she says, blushing. "Do you have them too?"
"What are you talking about you insignificant worm?!!" Tenko says, choking. "You have no right to speak! SILENCE!"
"Well," Felix says, toughening up again. "I guess maybe it was just a thing.... guess you don't have them either. How cliche."
	He walks over to the book shelf. Tenko is still writhing on the floor.
"What is this?! Who is this man?!! Why do I get sick when I make eye contact?!" Tenko thinks to himself."
	Felix picks out some books and pages through.
"Hmm...so many research and mythological books. But in a cathedral? It's odd, don't you think, Tenko?" she says with a cold smile.
"What are you babbling on about?!" Tenko says, recovering from the effects.
	Felix says nothing. She picks up a book on one of the desks.
"Notes," she reads. "What a harmless title."
	Tenko gets up and stares at her. She is looking through the book. There is a long pause as she reads. Suddenly she drops the book, a horrified look on her face.
"T-they really did know..." She says, shaking her head. "How cliche..."
"What is it?" Tenko asks, interested.
"Tenko!" Felix says, turning around, glaring. "Whatever you do... Don't trust anyone from Waterline or this cathedral and other churches associated with it. I'm warning you."
"What are you-" Tenko says with a glare.
"Thanks," Felix says stiffly, and then she runs out.
"No, wait, you heretic --!" Tenko yells, but she is out of there in a flash.
=================================================
	Tenko thinks about all that Felix said. Did they really kill innocent people instead of protect people from the dangers of heretics? No, he can't believe a devil. He then wonders what was so bad about the book. He picks it up and reads through it... 
"Our Waterline spies found another heretic today. He goes by the name of Felix. They say he's an avid murderer and a thief." He pages again. "Apparently this Felix man has the Blood Window... doctor will surely be pleased." Page. "Plans have been made to dispose of the man, and in the same fashion get bodies for the experiment as well." Page. "Bombing Waterline seems the best idea. Will kill two birds with one stone." Now Tenko is disturbed. Page. "A Psephis will bring the bombs to our affiliate St. Avril. Bring to Waterline. Head doctor and assistant will take care afterwards."
	Kooters drops the book in disblief. "This can't be!" He says. "I have to seek the truth...maybe at St. Avril." He sets to trek out to St. Avril to try and find more details, and when he arrives, he notices a motorcycle parked outside. He recognizes it as the one parked outside of Felix's house, too. It must be his.
	He goes in and finds everyone dead. Felix has already arrived here and is found in the basement trashing through files. He is about to hack some up until Tenko arrives and says wait a sec. 
=================BEGIN SCRIPT====================
"What a surprise," Felix says in amusement. "How cliche. What are you doing here?"
	Tenko walks up.
"Listen, ... humm, Felix, it is your name, yes?" he asks.
"Yes."
"Felix, I must ask you something."
"What is it?"
"Well... my goal.. as a psephis.. was to protect the people from the evil of heretics. But.. after hearing you and the bishop converse... I have become more interested in what I was doing for these past years instead of doing what my designated job was.. to protect the people.."
	He walks up.
"Do you know something about the psephis that... I do not? Please tell me, Felix."
	Felix snorts.
"Well. You're not only cliche but DUMB."
	Felix walks up to one of the shelves.
"Don't you know? The psephis are feared because not only do they pick strong warriors like you to dish pain out in spades, but because of their notorious ploys to kill the innocent and lure the murderers for purposes unknown."
"Whatever do you mean?"
"Your "heresy" claims you follow from the church are nothing but lies. The church has swayed the talented psephis to do the work for them because they are too chicken to do it themselves. You see. After reading some of the files here... It is apparent that the church believed in anything BUT a "God". they use their heresy claims as just a puppet for their real cause because the only people to join the psephis --"
	He looks directly at tenko
"-- are the people who believe in God the most and will literally fight for the cause. Understand that your purpose was a big lie, dear Tenko. The psephis are only there to murder people who the church claim to be heretics. But these "heretics" are only innocent people, mostly family members, connected to murderers and serial killers. They learn the murderer's instincts and ties, then kill the families and whoever is close to the murderer while leaving a note to come visit the church to get some patronization, acting like they didn't do jack shit. Then they kill the murderers and examine the corpse."
"Why would they do that...?"
"The church doesn't want to fight for "god". they just want my power, hmmmmhmmm, cliche written all over."
"Your.. power?"
"Ah. I talk too much..i t's nothing, really. I'm just a little "special" ... isn't that cliche? I've got a little thing that kills people, lots of people.. that's why the church targets murderers. Because they want what I have."
"I don't understand. what do you have that the church wants so bad?"
"I can't tell you. Just something that, if the church gets, they will fuck everybody up."
"...."
	Felix walks back to Tenko.
"I was reading some notes in this place after I murdered every dickweed here. Apparently there's some mythological crap thats connected to this thing I have that kills people. They apparently believe in that stuff, and they believe they can achieve some kind of god or whatever from stealing this thing I have. The psephis are connected with Waterline, some super secret stuff i suppose. it's the hospital that's right next door to my house. Once they found out about me, they hounded me like no tomorrow. I'm always outside now. I can't stand it anymore... but now that the bishop is dead, I doubt anyone's going to be after me now."
"I do not understand! Felix, why can you not tell me? I deserve to know, my life was consumed by the pride of being a Psephis! Do tell me..."
"How cliche. You don't have to understand. Dont worry about it. You don't have anything to do with this. You're just a little puppet. Just go back to your family or whatever. I'll take care of this."
	He walks towards the door.
"See ya." He disappears.
=================================================
	Tenko follows him out but by the time he gets out, the motorcycle is gone. Tenko still has questions to ask Felix. So he tries to remember where his house was. He finds the motorcycle outside so he knows its him. He knocks on the door but nobody answers. He opens the door and finds felix with a tournaquet around his arm just about to inject a syringe into his arm. Tenko calls out to him and Felix looks up, being interrupted. Tenko walks up and asks what he's doing. Felix shrugs and just says he's getting high. Tenko says nothing and Felix asks what he's doing here.
=================BEGIN SCRIPT====================
"I still needed to ask you some things I cannot comprehend," Tenko says, shaking his head.
"How cliche. I told you not to worry about it, you crackhead," Felix growls. "Just stay out of it. I only do things for myself."
"Felix, don't even try to tell that to me! All the people I trusted... I cannot trust anymore! So... you seem to know the most about this, so I wanted to confront you..."
"Uh... confront me?"
"This is... your fault!" Tenko glares, "Whatever 'thing' you have that you aren't telling me about that the church wanted so bad, that it made them become corrupt, it's your fault! If you didn't have that 'thing', none of this would have happened, would it? So get rid of it!"
	Felix stands up.
"Listen, nutjob, it's kinda impossible to get rid of this 'THING' without DYING. FURTHERMORE, it's not MY fault the church is a bunch of greedy fuckwads. It's YOUR fault for joining the corrupt little shits. If you came here to call me names then get the fuck out of my house! Nobody invited you anyway!"
	Tenko grabs Felix by the collar,
"Then stay out of this. This is my problem now. You think you can take ahold of a situation which isn't even yours?"
	Felix opens his mouth to say something, but doesnt. Tenko puts him down,
"I must destroy the corrupt officials that still survive... I will start with Waterline. I must protect people from any of their horrible schemes. Goodbye. Thank you for the information."
	Tenko is about to walk out but Felix calls to him.
"Wait a sec..." Felix mumbles. "You're telling me you're going in there all alone?"
"I don't need you."
"I don't need you either! Ha!"
	Tenko walks out the door, but as he as about to close it, Felix pops in again.
"Well, um... you're going in there right now?"
"Do you see me as an idiot? Causing a commotion at this time of the day is a bad idea. I am waiting till midnight."
"So..."
	Felix taps his foot.
"You got nowhere to stay do you?"
"I was going to stay at a local motel."
	There's a pause.
"Well, you could... stay at my place for the night."
"... You are serious?"
"Pft, well hey if you don't want the offer then don't take it!"
"No... please wait a moment. If you really do not mind then I will stay..."
	Felix gives a glare, and then opens the door.
"So cliche..."
=================================================
	Felix tells tenko he can sleep on the couch till night, and if he wants any food he can go in the cabinet and get whateer. But she warns him that he's not allowed upstairs, and if he tries to go up, Felix will break his ribs. Tenko acknowledges this and he sleeps there till nighttime. "Tonight, hopefully I'll find some clues as to what the church was up to, and to find that certain doctor they referred to.. but there are so many doctors..."
	When he wakes up, he prepares to go but finds Felix waiting for him at the door. He is about to ask why she's waiting there and thus she reminds him that she's only coming with because of her own personal reasons, and she isn't helping anyone else, including him. He agrees to her standards.
	They bust into the hospital at night. They have to knock any staff who walk up unconscious. They find only one doctor and demand answers from him. The doctor refuses to speak so they just piss him off.
=================BEGIN SCRIPT====================
"Anyone in here?" Tenko calls out. The doctor turns around in the darkness.
"Who are you?" he says stiffly.
"Hey! I want answers buddy, and you're gonna have to supply them or else I'm gonna fuck you up!" Felix yells.
"Felix, wait," Tenko says. "You're a doctor here right?"
"Yes, and?" the doctor says. He looks directly at Felix but then gets a giant smile on his face.
	The doctor starts laughing. Puzzled, Tenko and Felix both look at each other.
"So you finally made it, little Astral Carrier? Felix, was your name, right?" the doctor holds up a knife, "Is it true that you killed the Bishop Gregory? I wouldnt be surprised if you did! hahaha!"
"Astral Carrier?" tenko pauses.
"So what if I did!" Felix glares, "How do you know who I am? Who are you?! Mr. Cliche?"
"No need to know. What is important now is that you must die, for your sake and for mine!"
"I can't allow you to hurt any more people, now that I'm sure who you are--" Tenko prepares a fighting stance "--You're the "doctor" referred to in the notes from St. Avril... Your scheme must end. For all the corruptness you hold!"
"Please," the doctor says, "You're of no interest. Back away."
	he turns to felix.
"All those wasted lives is such a shame, isn't it? All the Psephis that tried to steal your beautiful eye were all slaughtered by you, weren't they? Hmm, who's the real villain?"
"That's sick-- So cliche--" Felix mumbles, "I don't care about anybody else. I'll kill a thousand men just to stay alive. guilt trips can't work on me, buddy--"
"That's enough talking," the doctor says, "Die and be silent. Give me your power."
=================================================
	Tenko fights the doctor instead as felix protests, But then he kicks both of their asses, and they find themselves in a damp cellar, tied up. Felix has her blinders on again. The doctor comes in and explains how the church wanted the Blood Window more than the government, and they were constantly in a battle to obtain the eye for their own purposes. He mentions now that the main bishop in the area is gone, the evil eye will belong to him. The doctor comes up and gives Felix a sleep-inducing drug, but as the doctor is turned around from Tenko, he roundhouse kicks the doctor to the face while he's tied up and saves Felix yet again. The doctor is knocked unconscious. Tenko has thoughts about harming him, but he is more concerned with Felix, and he takes Felix out asap.
=================BEGIN SCRIPT====================
"ha..uh..mmmmurr." Felix wakes up. he looks around "Where's this?"
"My top priority was getting you out before that doctor did something nasty to you. It seems they're really after you, badly."
"What're you talking about?"
"He gave you something that made you sleep... so I saved you, but just now a bunch of people from the hospital came and ripped your house to shreds, looking for you. I ran straight to this alley and watched them from afar... I brought your motorcycle since you seem to like it a lot."
"Oh, my Alice. You saved her, thanks..."
"..."
	Pause.
"Will you tell me why they want you so badly? Why do they call you Astral Carrier? Could you be ・・・"
"..."
	Pause.
"...Are you blind?"
".....Aaah, weelll, no, I just... have some sight problems with my right eye."
"Then why won't you show them you aren't blind? Hmmm? If you're not blind you shouldn't have... the eye, right?"
	Felix looks at Tenko with a very worried face. They say nothing.
"Well, I guess I should say a few things, shouldn't I?" Tenko says.
	Felix blankly stares at him.
"Where should I start? Well... my name is Tenko, obviously... I've been a Psephis for about 8 years and I can't cook." he chuckles a bit. "I'm getting married in less than a year to a wonderful girl, my dad is a cardinal and --"
	He turns to find Felix lighting a cigarette. He sighs and looks with frustration.
"Felix, are you even listening? Should I even bother with an introduction? Why must you always be so rude?"
	Felix bites hard on her cigarette and pulls out a gun, putting Tenko at gunpoint.
"Shut up."
	There is a pause. She slowly puts the gun down and reclines back to the wall.
"My right eye suffers from exposure to light. I like tentacles and blood, and my dad's dead."
	Tenko opens his mouth as to say something, but he doesn't say anything. It isn't enough to satisfy his curiosity but he doesn't say anything else.
=================================================
	They sit there in some silence for a few minutes and then Felix gets up. She tells Tenko that this mission is over and she starts walking to her house. Tenko mutters under his breath and asks her why she won't accompany him. She snorts and says that as long as the doctor leaves her alone, she isn't involved in this. Tenko notes that now that the doctor has actually met her, she's going to be hounded. Felix pauses for reconsideration, then turns around and smiles slyly "I will follow in your footsteps, but the purpose is for myself, and myself only." Felix officially joins him. Tenko says that they need a plan to get the doctor alone and then kill him while he's off guard. Felix says that they have to first kill off the remaining church people engaged in this plot so that he has no one to turn to when he's in need of help. She asks tenko if there's anyone he knows. He muses a bit and notes that other than Bishop Gregory of the Saintmorning cathedral, one of the priests in Saintmorning has been a bit screwy as well. Their new plan is to completely fuck up Saintmorning of all the evil church members.







	When they arrive, they hide in an alley next to the house. They see the doctor coming down the street, going into each house. Felix chuckles again, and once he gets to their house, right before he knocks on the door, Felix jumps him and they roll around on the street, beating each other up. He knifes Felix in the arm, so Felix jumps back and starts blowing bombs on the doctor. The doctor cleverly rolls around, avoiding the psychic bombs. The doctor throws a knife straight at Felix, and Felix dodges it. While he does, the doctor runs away in the smoke of the bombs. They chase after him, but he is gone. Felix swears and says he's probably running back to Waterline. Tenko asks if he wasts to see his parents and he answers no. They run to Waterline.
	They run into complications: Felix takes a shortcut to try and get there before the doctor arrives, and accidently bumps into the Hisatsu territory. He meets up with Eouen, the second-in-command to Raven. Tenko is stumped and confused but Felix doesn't want Tenko involved, so he pretends Tenko is the Illuminati's hostage. He puts a gun to Tenko's head (Tenko freaks and Felix whispers, "I won't hurt you."). Eouen is surprised by the fact that they need a hostage and Felix explains he's from St. Morning and the Illuminati are doing research on the church's actions. Eouen wants to know their secret plan but Felix says no, so they duke it out.
	After Felix wins, Eouen runs away to tell Raven the news. Tenko is confused and Felix explains that Eouen is part of the Hisatsu, one of the biggest gangs in the city. The Hisatsu are Illuminati's worst enemies. Tenko asks who the Illuminati are and Felix explains that Oyarsa is the leader, and Illuminatians are identified by the purple crest on their chests. Tenko puffs up and says "That's why you're so so 'chesty'." Felix snorts and says all the Illuminati must display their insignia lest it be disrespectful. They go back to Waterline, but they find it's closed and it's too much of a hassle to break in. They continue their pursuit later, but fir right now, they walk over to Felix's house.
	They're in Felix's house, and when they get inside, Felix immediately opens a drawer and closes it and sits on the couch. Instinctively, the player will want to open the drawer, but it's locked. Speak to Felix and he tells you to sit down. You do, and Felix takes out some drugs and starts to wrap a turniquet around his arm and injects some heroin in there. While he does, he starts to talk. "So you still coming with me to barf on the doctor?" "Y-Yes." "Cool. I want after him 'cos he ain't leaving me alone now. Really pissing me off." "I'm still worried of the safety of the patients and the surrounding appartments. And... well, yours." Felix giggles like a girl. "Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. You need to worry more about yourself. The doctor has some mean tricks." Tenko mumbles, "Don't act so tough." Felix says, We're in this together. We'll take him down. Serves him right." There is silence till Felix feels the drugs and falls over, spazzing. Tenko bends over to help him but Felix just replies, absentmindedly, "Hehe. I'm fine. It happens when you inject the stuff intravenously." 
	He stops after awhile and finds Tenko sleeping on the couch. he stares, then smiles and goes to make some food. He makes some soup and saves some for Tenko. He wakes up and Felix lets him have some. He eats it and Felix tells Tenko he can crash here for the night. He also tells him feel free to watch TV or make some food. They both go to sleep. Tenko wakes up in the middle of the night and tries to open the locked drawer, but fails. He goes back to sleep.
	The next day, Tenko wakes up and finds Felix missing. He notices a bowl of cereal on the table. He goes outside and finds Felix smoking. They say good morning and there is a pause. "Good sleep?" Felix asks. "Better than none," Tenko says. Felix laughs and tells him to get ready, theyre going to St. Avril. Tenko asks why St. Avril and Felix says the doctor is a friend to the p riest of Avril, and he went there to talk about this business. Tehey pack up and go. They arrive and find that the church is locked. Felix scales a wall and breaks through a stained window, and unlocks a door.
	Felix finds it eerie how empty the church is. They go into the back room where Felix originally trashed up some files, and take another door to reach the lab. They meet two scientists doing experiments. They see Felix and they freak out. "It's the man with the eye! Get him!" Felix explodes the ground around them as a warning and demands to see the doctor. They tell him only if he gives up the eye. Felix gets pissed and tells Tenko to find the doctor while he deals with these two clowns. He runs off, and now Felix is left with the two scientists.
	He slowly corners on them and they get all scared, so while he's about to knife them they splash chemicals into his eye. He screams and attaches his eyepatch to his good eye. The new focus is on his blue eye. The scientists hide behind a table as Felix looks aorund, and he looks straight at them. They turn blue but realize that's the Blood Window and he can't see them. They leave him blinded and run away. Felix collapses from the pain.
	Switch to Tenko, who is a corridor away from the doctor. He is about to open the door when the two scientists come running toward him. He round kicks them and asks what happened. One begs for his life and says Felix and another doctor took him. Tenko is about to speed away but the door opens nad the doctor + priest pop out. "Well well, who do we have here?" the doctor chuckles. "He's from the St. Morning sect.. Tinko, was it?" priest says. "It's Tenko," he says, "And I'm going to screw you up." He kicks the priest in the face and punches the doctor but he jumps back. "now aren't we lively? have you come for your friend?"
	"for felix and for the wrongs you're concocting!" he punches the doctor but he dodges again. "i won't let you hurt felix or bomb the hospital just to get him! don't you know, I'm a psephis!" he roundhouses but the doctor dodges and kicks tenko. he falls back and the priest gets up. "so you know our plan? what kind of soldier of god are yu?" "you...kill...just to capture an innocent man like felix!" tenko says. "innocent? hardly. he's not innocent. he wields the Blood Window, don't you know that, you idiot!" silence. flashback to the explosions he saw, and felix lying about the eye. tenko is stunned, but then he gets up. "no wonder," he murmurs. "no wonder why he keeps it a secret. to stay away from people like YOU. stay the hell away from felix!"
	the doctor and tenko get into a fight. after tenko defeats him, he finds the priest gone. in the back room we hear screams. Tenko abandons the unconscious doctor and goes for the priest. felix takes care of himself and uppercuts the pastor. he has his blinder on. Tenko takes it off for him and there is a short pause. "thank you," he says. Tenko is staring at the eye. Felix is uneasy and attaches the eyepatch back. Tenko shakes out of it and beckons that the doctor is unconscious in the hall. they head out and find he is gone. "how cliche," felix muses, "we'll have to see where he goes next." "how would we know?" tenko asks. felix turns around. "let's ask the priest." he walks in and kicks him. "wake up, cos we want answers." the priest wakes up and immediately pulls out a gun to felix. "you can't kill me. knock that shit off, because you know it as well as i do." felix says. he bats the gun out of the priests hands. "tell me where the doctor went." the priest says he went back to waterline to test some samples. felix asks what theyre up to. the priest says nothing, so he shoots them till hes dead. they go around the lab and find out what theye been trying to do.
	they find the doctor's note, something about "finding others". there is a list of people and a list of certain types of eyes. The only one he has written down is "Ruofl - Waterline inhabitant". Felix wonders what he means by "ruofl". he skims further down the page and notices that it says the doctor will have to take embryos and put the eye cells into them to create them into gods, then soak them in the blood of virgins, as the legend goes.. Then once he gets the Blood Window, he'll use it to destroy humanity and build a utopia. Felix and Tenko don't know what he's talking about, but felix is disturbed greatly by this and feels if they get ahold of his eye, he will destroy life as we know it with its immense power. tenko mentions that he just found out felix has the eye, and complains why he didnt just tell him before. felix says he has to be cautious because he cant let ppl like the doctor get his eye. tenko asks how he has it and felix explains his entire story (more on this later..). he mentions the doctor only wants it for the power so he can do this. tenko is worried about felix so he ensures he'll get rid of the doctor and all evil church members. felix says nothing and they walk to waterline.
	they see the doctor going and felix stops him. the doctor asks whats the matter and tenko mentions the embryo project. the doctor just laughs and goes inside, locking the doors. Felix gets super pissed off and tries to kick the door open but it won't budge. tenko steps in and says "allow me." he punches it and it shatters. Felix stares at him, and they go inside. They find that everyone is dead. the walls are encrusted and splattered with blood. all the nurses and the doctors and the patients are dead. While they are walking, a hand grabs onto tenko's boot. he looks down and finds that a zombie nurse is grabbing him! he kicks it off and felix shoots it. they look at each other, worried, and go through the hospital carefully.
	on the second floor they find the doctor walking towards the next stairwell and tenko yells for him to stop. he turns around and holds up a gun and snickers, "what a delicious opportunity to get my eye. I didn't even have to go anywhere." He shoots Felix but it lands in his arm. He flinches and pulls out his machine guns, aiming to shoot the doctor but misses horribly from the pain. tenko runs up and starts fighting with the doctor, batting the gun out of his hands. finally he pins the doctor to the floor and grabs the gun and holds it up to his head.
	felix slowly walks over bleeding, and the doctor starts to laugh. felix asks why does he want to do this so much. tenko cries why did he have to kill all the people in this hospital. doctor explains that because you messed up the plans to bomb waterline, where some peoplew ould actually survive, they had to kill every single body in here for the corpses to experiment on. felix yells why would they need dead bodies, their cells are infunctional. the doctor chuckles and says that they should have seen a few zombies roaming around the hospital. tenko is stunned from this and starts to beat the doctor up. Felix says wait and then asks what his intentions are; what is he talking about with this god stuff. the doctor snorts and then says because he wants to be the renowned one to make this come true, he wants to be the real god, and says Felix wouldn't understand his own roots even if the doctor tried to explain. he mentions felix is different from anyone else and he needs him to give up his eye to succeed. Felix starts getting emotionally disrupted and explains he will never give up his eye to somebody so evil.
	the doctor, seeing that felix is getting very emotionally upset, starts to laugh. he says, if the eye is so powerful, why doesn't it keep Felix from being so scared of its own power? felix stops dead in his tracks when he says this; it hits his nerve. the doctor also says, "why are you worried about this, little puppet? you don't really have feelings, do you? little monster."
	Just then the ground below him breaks, and all objects in view shatter, the walls start to crack. This is the first sign of his emotional destruction. "i'm ... human." felix murmurs. The building begins to collapse with the damage of felix's emotion burst. Tenko gets distracted. the doctor smirks and runs out. he murmurs under his breath, "The blind, warm eyes... I've just found you... Tenko." tenko notices the doctor (doesn't hear him) but he's more concerned with felix right now. the two of them are left in the empty, collapsing hospital.
	They run out as fast as they can and watch outside as the hospital collapses, the building in shambles. The police and ambulences arrive, and Tenko and Felix are watching from afar. Felix drops down, his head in his arms, and starts shedding tears. there is silence.
	tenko says, "felix, tell me something." "no." "felix, i'm a psephis. please answer me." "i don't give a rat's ass if you're a psephis. don't try to abuse your powers on me." short pause. "a psephis is entitled to question anyone they want for answers; they can kill and hurt people for the purpose of the church," tenko muses, "so how do you ignore that?" Felix says, "then i'll have to fight you, too." another pause. "humans have the ability to rise up and overcome the most difficult obstacles. it's wether you want to use this ability or not differs you a human from a monster."
	there is another pause. "But that huge explosion... did you do that with your psychic power ?" felix looks over and his eyes are bleeding. tenko stares at him. "B-bleeding still? I thought it stopped when we got out of the hospital. What did you do to yourself?" he asks. felix says stiffly, "these are tears. mine are blood. they're different from humans. and these" he runs his finger down the tattoo on his face "are the tears i wish i had."
	"...you cannot cry?" "tears of blood fall from my eyes." "......." felix looks away, "the eye does things to me that aren't supposed to happen to regular people." silence. tenko leans over and wipes his blood away. felix looks at him with surprise and tenko says "wipe your tears away. we have a doctor to catch." pause, then felix smiles and takes out his gun and stands up. "that's right." tenko stands up. "Where could he be? do you know?" felix pauses, and looks at the hospital. "he's at the suicidal clock tower." "how do you know?" "they say the clock tower is haunted 'cos people who go around there commit suicide and no one knows why. that's why it's called the suicidal clock tower. i know he went there 'cos people say they see zombies around there. and what did we see in waterline? ... zombies, of course. he said he needed corpses to experiment on, and what better place to get corpses in your secretive ways other than the suicidal clock tower?"
	pause. "so you're saying he went to the clock tower to experiment with more zombies?" "yap. cos it's abandoned and nobody goes there. best place to do your dirty stuff. ionno why he needs zombies to make embryos... but whatev. we'll stop him there." tenko complies and they go to the clock tower. when they arrive, they get an empty, cold feeling inside, and they tell each other if they feel the suicide motion, tell each other immediately. inside they find lots of zombies and dead things, so when they make it to the top they find nobody except the doctor's tools, so he definitely has been here. except a huge ass zombie comes out of nowhere and attacks them!
	after they fight it, it explodes in a flurry of blood, and they wonder why a huge zombie was in the lab. "how cliche," felix muses, "he must have left it there for us." "No," a voice rings from the hallway. "That was the first of a type I recently created." The heroes look behind them. They hear footsteps and the doctor enters. "What a regular villain entrance," felix says with a toothy grin. Tenko steps forward and asks what zombie type he speaks of. The doctor explains that he made that zombie type sensitive to the light that reflects from Ruofl and Lysto's eyes. Felix freaks out in a pissed way and asks what the fuck he's talking about with Ruofl and Lysto. The doctor shakes his head and says they wouldn't understand.
	He also notes that this is only step one of his master plan, and felix is the very last. felix pulls out his guns and remarks, "Too bad it will never be finished. Goodbye, you lunatic." He shoots but a zombie materializes and takes the hits for him. Felix gets pissed and starts nailing the bullets, but they only absorb through the zombie's skin. Tenko mumbles, "So you have zombies doing all the work for you, eh? Taking advantage of the souls of the dead... You cruel, sick bastard." The doctor chuckles. "I'll advise you to not touch anything here, lest you become zombie food, and leave.. NOW. you don't want to die, do you?"
	Felix lowers his gun, and tenko goes back to normal stance. "As I thought," The doctor muses, "Now leave before I destroy you. I don't have time to play with you... I like to do things according to schedule. Your deaths are not needed at the moment, but if needed, I'll mess up my schedule." "What are you up to, you crazy bastard?" Tenko asks. The doctor explains that this tower is full of the damned, those that committed suicide as a result of the tower's eerie aura. Their souls rest in this place and he materializes their remnants and animates them.... like this. The zombies materialize and start cornering the heroes to the window. "And it's only part one of my twisted plan..."
	Felix muses to himself, "These zombies... They can't be damaged with regular weapons, so... a psychic bomb...?! No, I can't a chance with Tenko here..." he backs off and pulls Tenko towards him. "Listen. I think he's just making these things stronger... these are indestructable! I would try a psybomb but I don't want to hurt you. We have to get out of here!" Tenko whispers back, "What?! How?! They're cornering us!"
	He takes a deep breath, and grabs Tenko and they fall out the window. Tenko screams like a little girl, but Felix uses his energy to create a psychic barrier around them, and they bounce to safety. he dispells it once they reach the bottom. "W...what in all hell was that?" Tenko asks in amazement. "It's a psychic barrier. Aren't you glad you're with me?" Tenko smiles. "yep.."
	They get up. "We're in deep shit," Felix explains. "These zombies... I think I'll know what he'll do. He'll try to make a zombie embryo... just like us humans, he won't try to materialize them from an exact corpse. (he starts turning white) He'll.. BREED them.. and GROW them... but..." He looks away. "I don't know what he's talking about with Ruofl and Lysterine or whatever. I think he just might be nuts." He suddenly jumps. "Fuck! If he gets ahold of this eye, the world- the world--" he collapses from faint. Tenko comes to his rescue.
	It's now nighttime. Felix is still out cold and Tenko carried him to a nearby stree corner. He's thinking to himself now. "The doctor... he's got a cover of near-indestructable zombies with him now. That heretic, why does he want to destroy everything? Breeding zombies... no, it's no good..." He looks over at felix. "Felix, what do we do? How do we kill the doctor and exterminate his plan? You're really smarter than you think, but this..."
	Felix wakes up. "Fuck and christ, how long was I out?" "I don't know. Thankfully you're okay." Felix looks around, and puts on a snarl. "Man, the doctor is going to go fucking up the city and soon the country if he starts using these zombies. That bitch. If this goes on too far... there may be drastic changes... and I'll have to take myself to fuck him up." tenko looks at him quizzically. Felix looks at himseriously. "It doesn't involve you. don't worry about it." "..." "We gotta think of a plan, tenko. this is bad." "i know..." they think and felix gets a brainstorm. "oh!  you remind me. illuminati!" "your gang." "you remembered? that's cool. anyways, we'll ask oya if he can do anything. i'm sure he can help us kick up a few zombies!" "if you say so. I hope you're right."
	When first arriving at Illu HQ and seeing Oyarsa, Oyarsa tells Felix off for failing against the Hisatsu and not killing eouen. He hurts her feelings and Tenko goes off on Oyarsa, telling him to apologize to her. Oyarsa gets pissed and they start to fight, but Felix uses her emotional side to pull Oyarsa off of Tenko and to say he was just worried. Oyarsa scowls at Tenko, then spits in his face and walks back. Tenko aggressively wipes off the spit and glares, but then asks why felix suddenly has a feminine voice. Felix cleans his face and shrugs, saying its just a thing that something happens. she explains that it was just a thing and not to go off on Oya. Tenko asks why she didn't stick up for herself and Felix mentions she had no reason to since she failed his plans. Tenko is angry that she is so tough on the outside but she softens up when she's in the presence of her gang leader. Felix says it's just a thing, again. Later when Felix talks to Oya alone, he mentions he was pretty impressed with Tenko that he would pick a fight with him.
	Tenko is told to wait outside by himself but he refuses to take orders, so the guards take him hostage. the other illuminati watch him carefully. Felix explains that Tenko is not an enemy and he's only following him till now and asks to let him go. she tells oya of the current situation and they need his help. oya muses and tells felix to wait in his room, he'll explain later. he orders the guards to bring tenko in. tenko scowls at oya. Felix is watching from behind a door.
=================BEGIN SCRIPT====================
"Hello, Tenko."
	Tenko glares coldly.
"What do you want?"
	Oya walks up to him.
"You are... a psephis?"
"That is right," Tenko says with a glare. "What do you suppose you'll do with this information?"
"As I suspected."
	Oya walks to a wall.
"Felix didn't tell you? Hmph."
"Felix only told me you were travelling with him until now."
"...."
"I assume you know about the church's plot to find the perfect god."
"I sort of understand."
"It doesn't really matter."
	Oya walks back to Tenko.
"I have a question to ask you."
"...What do you want?"
"It is --"
=================================================
	Suddenly, the building is blown up. Felix thinks its either the Hisatsu or the doctor and he checks it out. "Come out come out wherever you are, dear Felix," a voice not heard before yells. Felix is about to go outside to see who it is but Tenko comes out and pushes him away. "You'll get hurt!" "No, I won't, you nutjob! Let me go too." Oya is watching from afar.
	They both go out together and a find a man (Wound). The doctor's assistant.
=================BEGIN SCRIPT====================
"So who's this weirdo?" Felix asks with a raised eyebrow.
"My name is not important," Wound says with a smirk. "The only thing you must know is that I serve under the doctor, and by his command, you will be destroyed!"
"Not on your life, pal!" Felix yells.
	He prepares a psychic bomb.
"Sorry, but I'm taking this one over," Tenko steps in front.
"What? You faggot! Get out of the way! You don't know what you're getting into!"
	Felix pusshes Tenko away and prepares to fight Wound.
"Look, I have to get revenge for the years I've wasted in deceit. If only you don't make yourself obvious, they won't come after you! You'll have no reason to fight them! So just leave it to me!"
"Tenko, you bird-brained, idiotic, stupid fucking sack of crap! I have more than enough reason to do this!"
	While they're distracted, Wound throws a capsule.
"Watch out!" Tenko yells. He pushes felix out of the way.
"Perceptive, aren't we?" Wound grins. "Now, fight!"
=================================================
	Tenko wounds Wound and he runs away, saying he'll get them another day. Felix calls Tenko a crackhead for being such an overprotective moron. "Sorry, I was just doing my duties as a real psephis," Tenko says with a weak smile. Felix lightens up and goes back to Oya with Tenko. Oya congratulates the both of them and they have a real meeting. He guides them to the room and tells them both to sit down.
=================BEGIN SCRIPT====================
"So, what was it that you wanted to ask me?" Tenko asks.
	Oya does the "excellent" finger-locking pose on the table.
"I watched you quarrel amongst yourselves. And I must say, Tenko..."
	He chuckles a bit, smirking.
"One as true as you does not come around too often."
	Felix and Tenko look at each other weirdly. Felix whispers, "He has weird humour." "I noticed."
"Anyways. I wanted to ask a favour of you, Mr. ..."
"Paine."
"Right, Mr. Paine. You exhibit such a caring aura around you..."
"And what would this observation? Why do you need me to do something for you? Why should I follow an order from you?"
"You owe loyalty to no one," Oya mumbles. "It is only a favour."
"Continue."
"I would like to ask if you would be Felix's guardian angel."
"WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTT??" they both shriek.
	Felix gets the anime look of disgust directly at Tenko. He points and says loudly to oya,
"You've gotta be FUCKING KIDDING ME! O-Yar-Saaaa! I said I'd only stick with this idiotic dumbshit until we reached illuminati! you can't possibly be thinking ... no! nooooooooo!"
"Guardian... angel?" tenko asks curiously.
	Felix begins banging his head relentlessly against a wall, now ignoring the conversation. Oup comes to comfort him.
"You possess a power that is yours alone. As of right now, I cannot tell you what it is. But do note that that alone does not lead me to believe you will take very good care of Felix. I know you can. Your sense of loyalty is... rather touching. Is that why you became a Psephis, to protect people? If you do not wish to accept this task, I will not take action. But you must note that any action against us will result in your life."
	He pauses.
"Felix is in need of someone who will defend him and his eye. The doctors' ploy will be complete if he gets ahold of that, and you must know how reckless Felix is."
"But how do yo uknow about the doct-"
"I know /everything/."
	There is a long, eerie silence.
"Oyarsa."
"Yes?" he looks up.
"I understand, completely!"
	Oyarsa smiles.
"Well then!" he stands up. "Felix, Tenko is going to be your guardian angel. Better get used to him."
	He walks away laughing. Felix screams.
"No, this can't be happening. This can't be happening. I'm not a little girl, Oya! Don't do this to me!"
"Don't worry!!" Tenko says, putting his hand on her shoulder. "I'll be by your side until I die!"
"HELP!!!!!!!!!!!"
=================================================




	Over the course of the story, before Tenko knows Felix is Chloe, Tenko notices he starts to develop feelings towards Felix. He freaks out every time he thinks about it because he knows he isn't gay; he doesn't like any other men and there are plenty of people like Felix, but there's something different about Felix he can't explain. When the secret's out, he tries to profess his love for Chloe, but she stops him short and he never gets to finish his sentence, only letting the player guess his question.

	The end: somehow before, the doctor removed Felix's eye and replaced his own with it, but he was not "the chosen", and he turned into a strange creature, but his own greed led him to be powerful, and now he only lives upon the power of the eye. Felix is stripped of his psychic powers and must resort to using regular weapons throughout the battle. The doctor's eye is cleverly shielded throughout the battle until Tenko weakens and distracts him. Felix plunges a knife through the Blood Window, but at the same time, the doctor blinds Felix by puncturing his right eye. The doctor dies, but Felix is scared, staggering around, muttering "I thought I was God... I thought this couldn't happen to me... I thought... I thought..." while he hopelessly wanders around, blinded, he happens to fall off the cliff they were fighting, meeting his death at the bottom filled with spikes. Tenko frantically jumps down and holds Felix in his arms, tearing. He whispers, "Chloe..." The game ends.


Oyarsa: So what do you think of Felix, eh?
Tenko: I think the man's crazy. He has this bizarre suspicion of a tree. Come on, a tree! Who would have thought! How many people, do you see going around, looking at trees and screeching as if they've been encountered by a homocidal maniac!

Tenko and Felix play Russian Roulette sometime....
someone makes fun of a mentally retarded person and Felix gets pissed and sticks up for the person.

There are several gambling places around town. Tenko can choose to gamble with the npcs, or you can choose Felix. Felix will refuse to gamble with others because he has loaded dice. He will set up his own gamblign thing and wait for people to come by. He will win every time. However, there is a 1/3 chance he will get caught every time he gambles. If he does get caught, neither Tenko or Felix will be able to gamble there for a long time.

THE BLOOD WINDOW: this originated from the Greek belief of the "Evil Eye curse". A person with blue eyes can cause the evil eye curse by admiring someone, and that someone gets headaches, nausea and other sorts of nasty side effects. the overall concepts of the EOTC and the evil eye curse may not be the same but the basics are on. felix has blue eyes (well atleast one of them), and it causes nasty things to happen.

Tenko is overwhelmed by the popularity of Felix. His face is on every poster and they can't walk into a convinient store without getting held off. Tenko's patience snaps and he drugs felix and drags him to bed, then ties him up to the bedposts. When Felix wakes up, Tenko is sitting on a couch holding a gun. This head is hanging low. "Where am I?" Fel mumbles. Tenko walks over and hides the gun behind his back. Fel smiles. "What's up?" "Felix, you're immortal, and I've been ok so far." He cocks the gun to Fel's head. His hand is trembling violently. Fel glares as if he was going to explode Tenko, but his heart stops him and he smiles, saying, "So it's come down to this, eh?" Tenko sheds a tear: "Felix..Felix... My patience, Felix... It's wearing thin... Felix, I can't do this! Please! I hope you can forgive me.. I'm so sorry..." He has to put another hand on the gun to keep it steady. His eyes are welled with tears. Felix is emotionless. Tenko stands there for awhile, but then he puts his head down and begins to cry. He hides his face in his arms. "You can't do it and everyone knows it. How cliche. Is it because even though I kill women and children, steal from the unfortunate, ruin the dreams and hopes of others, I'm still your friend? ... Listen to me, Tenko." Tenko halts crying and angles his arms so the gun is backwards to his head. "Your feelings are louder than you. Shoot me if that's what you feel. I won't hurt you." Tenko stands there. He finally lowers the gun from his head, and stares at Felix. They share a long moment of blank eye contact. Finally, Tenko raises the gun to Felix. "I'm so sorry," he says again. He bites his lip and shoots. Blood flies everywhere....
Felix dies. Tenko freaks out and runs out the door. It begins to rain. He locks it and looks through the window at a dead Felix. He's scared now. He runs away in fear from Felix's house, making sure he never goes there again.
some stuff occurs, and two weeks later he goes to look through a window at felix. his body has decayed, maggots infested his corpse. tenko feels this cold feeling inside. the blood is stained on the wooden floor and on the bed.
"Ok, ok, well atleast I know he's not a zombie now. He's dead... The eye is gone. I wonder who will be born with it now." Just then, a shadow passes by Tenko. He looks around and no one is around.

Felix is given work to do and he doesn't want to do it. He tries hard to finish it but he can't help it. at this time, felix is unplayable and you can only play as tenko. When tenko talks to felix, they have some random conversations:
F: Tennnnkoooo... let's go do stuff!   F: Tenko, let's go outside! Okay? Can we?   F: Tennnkooooooooo!!
T: You go finish.                      T: After you finish.                        T: Keep going.
F: That's not fair!!!                  F: Tennnnkooooo........                     F: I can't! Waaaah! I don't wanna do this!

The first time Tenko encounters Felix with the plant, Felix freezes and runs off to a corner, his face turning white. Tenko picks up the potted plant and examines it, and starts walking toward Felix with it, talking about it. Felix is off the walls now, and he is clawing the walls crying and screaming to get away. Tenko puts the plant to Felix's face, and Felix puts his hands to his head and screams loudly, and starts to cry. The floor and his clothes get soaked with the blood. Tenko realizes that it's the tree that's making him uneasy. He thinks, "What is wrong with him? Out of all the times he's been hit, punched, beaten, and nearly dead, he's never cried... but look at him now, this silly plant is inducing his tears... he got so terrified that he started to cry... he must have some serious emotional trauma affiliated with plants." Tenko puts the plant across the room and tries to comfort Felix, and Felix clings tightly onto him, ceasing to stop crying, and Tenko also gets soaked with blood, but he doesn't mind. Felix falls asleep in Tenko's arms, and Tenko carries him back to his house, leaving the plant.

Felix and Tenko visit a shop and get pencils. They don't exactly look at them at first, but then they go home to settle some things up. Felix stays at home because he's tired and tells Tenko to get some groceries. He complies and goes out. When he comes back, he hears loud crying. He runs upstairs and sees Felix on his bed crying. Tenko immediately drops the bag and reaches out to him, "Felix! Are you okay? What's wrong? Are you hurt? Felix! Felix, answer me! Felix!" He doesn't stop crying, and Tenko looks around. He sees the pencil broken in two,and it is covered with blood. He takes a closer look and the pencil is engraved with "YOU ARE SPECIAL, FROM JEWEL GROCERIES". Tenko is confused but he drops the pencil and comforts Felix in his distressed state. Felix finally stops crying and never does tell what he cried about (but maybe later?).

Lisa is an orphan, adopted by Felix. She is one of the Illuminati. Lisa considers Felix as a big brother and they do the regular brother and sister things together. Felix loves her more than anything and would choose Lisa over Tenko. But one day Lisa finally finds her mother again so she goes to join her. She assures her mother that she has the protection of the Illuminati. Oyarsa and Felix swear they'll protect her and Lisa. So one day we find out the Hisatsu are looking for a certain necklace that sells for millions of dollars. Lisa has this necklace, and it was given to her mother before she was orphaned. Felix is worried later and goes to check up on Lisa and her mother. Lisa is upstairs in her room when her mother goes to answer the door. She sees Felix and lets him in. He asks, "Where is Lisa?" The mother says she is busy with homework right now and Felix says she has to see her right now. The mother will not let him, so he shoots her. Lisa then runs downstairs to see what the gunshot was and she sees Felix and her dead mother. She shrieks and Felix holds her at gunpoint. "Lisa, give me your necklace and everything will be okay." Lisa is stunned and Felix repeats what he says. She then cries, "No, it was mommy's! I can't give it to you!" Felix says coldly, "Lisa, give me the necklace." She stands there. Once again Felix repeats, "Don't move, Lisa. Just take the necklace off and give it to me." Lisa tries to run, but Felix shoots her. He takes the necklace and says indifferently, "Hisatsu have no reason to worry now." He sits on the couch and has a smoke.
Later Tenko drops by at the Illuminati and says he can't find Felix anywhere, and he's not at his house. Oyarsa tells him to check Lisa's house, since he said he was going there. Tenko goes by Lisa's house and it is empty, barren. He sees the dead lisa and mother and the blood dripping on the floor. He is stunned and looks around, and finds Felix sulking on the couch, staring at the necklace. Tenko starts freaking out and asks why he did it, and that he went back on his word of protecting them. Felix coldly replies, "I did protect them. They have protection forever now. The Hisatsu can't get them in the astral plane."

Getting into the Illuminati-
Later on, Oyarsa will invite Tenko to join Illuminati. If you say no, you'll be neutral to both gangs and coming into any Hisatsu Territory will not warrant Tenko any harm. You can even buy and sell from them, and talk to them. Just make sure Felix isn't the lead.
If you choose yes, you'll have to fight one of your hardest battles, Felix. Felix is a very hard boss.
He will use 5 psychic bombs in a row, leaving Tenko with tight space to dodge. If he backflips, Felix uses a 6th bomb to try and bloe Tenko up in his approximate landing space, with a good chance of hitting him even if he dodges. If Tenko gets too close, Felix will knife him and if he jumps back, Felix will use Critical Swing to try to follow him in pursuit. When Tenko jumps in an attempt to do an earth split, Felix counters with a flying stab. If Felix gets hit by Burst Crack or Thousand Arms, depending on how close Tenko is, he'll either use Roundhouse Whirl to knock Tenko to the opposite side, or Plunge Attack.
Just when you think t's over, it's not - he turns into the Berbalang. Now he can throw up blood on the entire screen and Tenko has to run like hell to avoid it. Because his senses are dulled, he can't be knocked back or stunned. He will sometimes grab tenko, by opening up his body (Read: Skogul) and letting a giant hand materialize from it and pull him towards tenko. he will hold him and felix will take a bite out of him, causing blood poisoning (DOT).
After you defeat him, Oyarsa will take him back to recover, and welcomes Tenko to the Illuminati. You can get free stuff and buy for cheap, free repairs, and some other good stuff. When Felix comes to, he's stunned at Tenko's abilities and Tenko's pretty shocked about him too. Felix congratulates Tenko as the new member of the family. Oyarsa mentions he still has to get the tattoo and Tenko turns pale. He throws Felix the needle and tells him to do the honours. Felix is a little embarrassed, and tells Tenko to sit on the bed and to pull his shirt open. An embarrassed Tenko pulls open his cloak and lets Felix work on him. They're both blushing and Oyarsa is sitting there laughing. Felix mentions quietly that he can feel Tenko's heart beating, and they sit in silence until Felix is done. The crest of the Illuminati is finished.


"What is happiness? Happiness is a feeling of joy and glee... an antidote that counters depression, and a ray of hope to provide one in the deepest pit of despair. Happiness... is something that we all want, and we strive... to obtain it. But, it all depends on what this happiness is derived from. Is it from helping others? Or from hurting them? Either way..extracting happiness is possible from anything as long as you like doing it. But."
Felix leans close. "I extract happiness from being with you."

In a point where Tenko is getting the shit kicked out of him and Felix too, Felix gathers her strength to get up and protect him. "If you touch him once more, I'm gonna rip your skull off your neck and eat the brains inside." Villain (whoever this is) laughs and proceeds to beat Felix up some more. She's trembling from pain, she's weak, she barely stands. But she will protect Tenko. Finally when he delivers what he thinks is a last blow, she mutters, "I won't let you." She turns into the mindless, dull berbalang. The villain is surprised and tries to shoot her but her reactions are null and the bullets just pierce through her skin like it was a cloud. She slowly advances up to him and he backs into a wall, scared. She stares blankly into his face. He tries to kick her away but she is dull and just stands there, but because of the contact, barfs her blood all over him. This triggers her scent for blood and begins to tear into him, and once he is dead she devours him whole. She falls over on the ground, bloody, exhausted, passed out. The impact cracks her skull open. Tenko tries to get to her, but he passes out onto her.

I wanted to tell you, but this gash in the lie got deeper and deeper. If I pulled myself out of it, I kept thinking the destruction would be worse than before, and it would be better later when our mission is complete. I didn't want to decieve you but, I must keep incognito for fear of the safety of my life, rather, my eye. In this completely opposite change, the government has no documents on me, I'm just some bum that appeared in town one day. Chloe is missing... or so they say. But Tenko... don't get me wrong. She is missing. She's missing inside of me. When this eye formed, a part of me died that very day. My soul, I think... Chloe's soul. I can't regard myself to her anymore... I'm not Chloe anymore. She's just this conscience in the back of my head that I know exists, but everyone else thinks is dead. Right now... well, I think it's Chloe talking right now. Felix doesn't sound like a girl... does he?
I know, it's so strange, talking about myself in two different personalities. Nope, I'm not schizo... I'm just fucked up, and I hope you can understand.

t: "Why is your hair gray? Did you dye it that way?"
f: "no, I was born this way."
t: "you are albino?"
felix hops over a rock.
f: "half, i guess. i have red eyes. i think my skin would be whiter, too."
t: "if you had both of those eyes, you'd look like an albino, since they have no pigment."
f: "i don't think lightblue is my type. i look kinda freaky as it is."
pause.
t: "did part of your family mate with a cat or something? because the line across your iris is the resemblance to a cat's."
f: "i don't know."
t: "are you sensitive to light?"
f: "how should i know? are you trying to find out if i'm a cat or something?"
t: "well, felix, people usually aren't born with eyes like that... human and cat eyes are controlled by two different muscles."

Ruofl  :  Dying Earth   :  Felix  (decay and weaken)          (snake eyes)
Tirth  :  Ragnarok      :  Doctor (disaster and chaos)        (black eyes)
Cress  :  Bed of Thorn  :  Raven  (pain and sadness)          (blue, evil eyes)
Lysto  :  Spring        :  Tenko  (calmness and tranquility)  (fool's eyes (can't see very well)
Arnia  :  Ancient Moon  :  Oyarsa (wise and knowledgable)     (no eyes (or, covered in his case)

Ruofl's Curse is triggered when the carrier dies. Their only weakness is blinding their eye so they are unable to focus their psychic thoughts.
Tirth's Curse is triggered when the carrier is overcome by extreme insanity. Their only weakness is love.
Cress's Curse is triggered when the carrier succumbs to the illusion of pleasure. Their only weakness is when their charm reaches one of a high esteem.
Lysto's Curse is triggered when the carrier sheds tears. Their only weakness is taking their catalyst away so they cannot channel pain.
Arnia's Curse is triggered when the carrier's mind is overcome with hate. Their only weakness is when their eyes are exposed to light.

Felix explains about Ruofl, the god of gods:
Ruofl himself is a very weak god. Without the combination of other god's powers, he is merely nothing. However, you think even I inherit all of these gods' powers, I still inherit their weaknesses as well.
Thanks to Tirth, I have the desire to kill and destroy others without question.
Thanks to Cress, I can use my psychic powers -- which intertwine with Tirth's ability to destroy -- otherwise my psychic powers would not harm a soul.
Thanks to Lysto, I have shards of hope and love still in my soul, the power to care is not completely washed over by other gods, due to Arnia's ability to concentrate. But thanks to him, I get queasy when I see someone who is utterly depressed.
Thanks to Arnia, I can easily overcome somebody with a college education with only a piece of his knowledge. But thanks to him, my blind eye is sensitive to light. 
Lastly, Ruofl's base powers consist of inverting time and space and causing whatever is around me to rot... But my thoughts are useless if my left eye is blinded.

Arnia stabbed his eyes out to gain the knowledge of ancients. it is said his descendents will have no eyes.
lysto wished for a wold of peace and love, a calm world where hearts were intertwined by one. his wish was said to be a fool's thinking and he was blind to the real world. descendents are very poor sighted but have warm brown eyes.
cress relied on his bitter tongue and deep eyes to manipulate people and backstab them as soon as he could. his descendents are said to be cunning, and born all with deep blue eyes.
tirth was evil in himself and wanted to destroy the world with his own mind. his descendents are said to have black eyes, the colour of evil.
ruofl, the god of all gods, caused distruction wherever he went, and things decayed to little or nothing when he was involved in them. his descendents are said to an eye of the snake; a sign from the bible of satan that caused man's fall from grace. the other is blind, the Blood Window... blind because ruofl refused to see the faults within him.

ruofl has the power of all the preceeding gods and thus is the most powerful, after all he is the god of all gods. he is wise and knowledgable, like the ancient moon; he is kind and compassionate, like the spring; he can manipulate and bring sadness, like the bed of thorns; he can create anarchy and chaos, like ragnarok. 

basically the doctor is looking for the other descendants. and they're right here in his palm. he wants to take all of their eyes and force them into zombie embryos, making them ageless and indestructable, so they will grow and he will bathe them in virgin's blood, as the legend goes, and flourish them into gods. he then will take ruofl's eye and put it into himself, which will make him into the god ruofl himself, and to be the most powerful person in the world. "What do you desire after you reach the ultimate rank?"

Each of the descendents of the gods have their special powers. Felix is unable to die and he can turn himself into a zombie using ruofl's power to decay; he can spread his demon wings out. Lysto can cure pain and sadness just by caring about it, and can spread angel wings out. Arnia can plan brilliant things (battle strategies, etc), understand and percieve things in much clarity; their minds unable to think of lesser forms than their heightened mental strength; Arnia can spread golden wings. Cress can manipulate anyone's mind just by staring at them, he can make them do his bidding while they are fully aware they're being entranced by his eyes; cress has blue demon wings. Tirth can cause depression and negative thoughts into minds, fuck peoples' minds up and hit their nerves right where it hurts; he has grey demon wings.


Tenko is conversing with oya while felix takes a nap. this is after we find out felix has ruofl's spirit inside him and after he turns into ruofl. tenko is starts to talk about the eyes and the spirit and such, when felix wakes up. he goes to greet tenko but realizes oya and him are talking so she hides behind a door. she listens in, "Oya I think I need to leave Felix here. Frankly I am terrified if the doctor gets to her and only God knows what will happen next. She'll be safe with you. You wouldn't mind, would you?" "no, not a bit. if that is your choice." "Okay. Well, tell her I'll be gone for awhile. I'll just leave now while she's asleep so there's no painful goodbyes.." A shocked Felix takes on a horrified face and runs out of the building in a rush, she trips over things, crying. tenko sees and starts calling her name frantically, but oya stops him and tells him to let go if he is really serious. he's confused between emotions and business.
felix is crying uncontrollably in an alley. she really lost it. she talks to herself, "he's abandoning me. after this. that idiot, does he think he can kill the doctor alone? he needs me. he's so stupid..i don't want to be alone again.."


there's idle time to spare and you can talk to felix and you can ask her to train. if she wins, she will stomp on your face and cry out her victory. you have to keep fighting her until you finally beat her. you'll use your inner power and knock her knife straight out of her hand. she'll freeze and stare at it and gasp "w-why are you so strong...?!" while she's distracted, he'll pin her straight to the wall and smirk "checkmate." felix scowls "pf, that was cheap catching me off guard. I woulda creamed you if i wasn't distracted." tenko leans close to her face and says in an intimate tone "i think you just need a little more practice." felix smirks and blushes and they lean close to kiss, but philia comes in. "what are you doing?" she asks matter-of-factly. felix turns her head in shame and tenko freaks out "Er well we were just training. That's all." there's a short pause, and philia laughs. she then snorts, "You're lucky I'm not Oya. he would have CREAMED tenko into mashed potatoes." she smiles and then walks out. they're both pretty embarrassed and felix quickly says right after phi leaves, "Well um, I'll be downstairs... bye." she quickly leaves. Tenko sits on the bed and ponders what made him do that. If you go downstairs to talk to felix, she will say nothing but have a meek smile on her face.

Tenko will say something nasty to felix and she will get ultra pissed at him. she'll get the entire illu pissed at him too and he won't even be allowed near the hq. he tries to call her up on the phone but she will continually slam the phone down whenever he calls. he is about to give up on her until he meets Oup alongside the road. At first there's an awkward silence but then Oup recognizes him. She sits down and talks to him and asks what he did that was so bad, all they know is that you said something mean to her. Tenko is frustrated and says that he was just absentminded at the time and needed some space so he told her that he didn't give a damn about anything she ever says. Oup gives a sympathetic look and notes that felix can have that temper if you don't take care of her. Tenko says nothing and stares at the ground. Oup silently gets up and walks away back to HQ. Tenko notices afterwards and ponders whether to care anymore, if she was going to be like this every day then why should he bother. He gets up and is about to walk away. Winged jumps from a window and lands next to Tenko. He is startled and slowly looks behind him, and finds wing. He asks where he came from and Winged says Oup told me everything and told me to help you. Tenko gives this half-startled smile and asks how is going to help. Winged snorts. He leads Tenko to the back of the HQ and points to a window. "That's Felix's bathroom window," he says. Tenko watches as Winged scales the wall and removes a glass block from the window, feels around the back and opens it. He puts the rope down and then jumps down without any harm. Tenko is amazed and asked how he did that. Winged only smirks and points towards the window. Tenko thinks to himself, "i wonder if that's why they call him winged." He thansk Winged and tells him to thank Oup and he says goodbye. Winged nods and disappears. When he gets up into the window, he smells smoke. "She must be smoking," he muses. He finally gets into the bathroom and gets the rope wound up and then throws it out the window, then closes it. He opens the bathroom door and finds Felix lying on her bed smoking. She turns, freaks out, grabs her guns and aims them at tenko. Tenko calms her down and tells her that he's really sorry and he misses her. This makes her think but then she says he doesn't miss her, he only wants to hurt her feelings again. 

ENDING 1: In one of the last battles (near the end anyway), Felix loses her eye to the doctor, right. So she just goes berserk on Tenko and starts to attack him. Tenko has to choose whether to fight her or not. He notes if he badly damages her now, she can die. if he fights her, tenko has no choice but to hurt her. she falls over in a bloody heap, dead. So that means Felix is no longer usable, and you can no longer return to illuminati for fear of getting yourself in deep shit. You have to fight the final boss only with tenko now, which will be a lot harder than usual. when its over, he falls to his knees. he takes a broken shard of his knuckle and plunges it into himself, killing himself.

ENDING 2: you have to score high points with Felix to get this ending. When they kill the final boss, instead of felix stabbing, felix distracts the boss and then tenko stabs him. He dies, and Felix and Tenko are finally free. Felix asks tenko if it's still okay that she finally has one eye, and is now mortal again. Tenko nods and says that everything is going to be fine, and asks how it feels to be completely stripped of powers and the world is once again at peace. Felix shrugs and says now that she's mortal she can die again. Tenko says nothing, but Felix assures him she would rather sacrafice her immortality to die with him. "It's okay, descendent of Lysto. You're no longer in love with the devil." Tenko spreads his wings. They kiss.

ENDING 3: you have to have THE WORST point score with felix to get this one. As before, Felix distracts the boss and tenko stabs him, and then its over. They say nothing to each other. Felix looks at him, says "I guess it's over, for good." She walks out, leaving him alone. He says nothing, and the screen pans out to him walking in the city streets. He goes to Illuminati. He asks if Felix is here. Oya is stunned that he came back and everything is okay, he opts to hold a party. Tenko says to wait and asks where felix is again, oya says nothng. He walks off. 2 weeks later he comes back, and asks oya again if felix is here. He says felix hasn't been here for a long time. Tenko walks out and looks to the sky. "I wonder if I'll ever find her again..."

ENDING 4: You have to score EVERY SINGLE POINT possible with felix and have very high fame. they kill the doctor and felix's eye is gone, of course. As they're walking back to the illuminati, Tenko says, "Hey, one second. I need to get something from your house. You go on ahead to Illu." Felix offers to come with but again Tenko says its ok. So Felix walks back to HQ. She makes it there and they all cheer, but ask where tenko is. Felix says he went to get something from her house, and lo and behold tenko arrives. "Ah!" Tenko's here!" everyone cries. Felix asks what he needed to get, and tenko chuckles and tells everbody to take a seat and delivers a speech.
"Well, it's finally over guys, thanks to everybody's great work. I guess life will return to normal now, heh." (everyone laughs)
"Through this perilous journey, I would've never thought I'd meet up with someone like Felix. I hated him and first and well, hey, he hated me too."
"That's she, now!" Felix snorts.
"Right, woops... Well, we had our fun times together, the best and the worst, and damn did we work hard to get here. In most of these struggles, I felt like dying.. I felt so hopeless... but, Chloe taught me how to be strong. She taught me to never look back, and to hope for the best in any situation! To fight hard and know where you stand! ... Without Chloe, I would not even dream of being here. I believe I'd be still stuck under my father's destructive plans. But..."
"Chloe, you're gonna hate me for this...hahaha...well, throughout the journey I had always felt this sense of actraction to felix (they whistle and hoot) even though he was male. I thought I was turning gay!..but.. with her smile I'd fallen so deeply into, I'd melt in her hands on a hot summer day...all of the little moments we shared on this quest to destroy the doctor are true proof. I mean, I can remember them all, our first kiss, the first time we had sex, making out in the bathroom so Oya wouldn't see.. (crowd oohs, looks to oya, he just laughs) 


Felix is emotionally awestruck at her mother. she constantly looks for a man who is like her father, kind, caring, compassionate, so wonderful. after she got stabbed in the eye, felix's mother told her she was ugly and stupid, etc. the stress of the eye caused her to start using drugs. she soon ran out of money, and after she got the hysterectomy (her father approved of it, she didn't mention it to her mother), she started to steal money from her parents. she was too ashamed to tell her father, and he died from a falling tree (hence felix's agonizing fear of plants) in the midst of her career. she this is when she quit middleschool, and all the times after she got her hysterectomy her mother called her manly and ugly, and when she found about her thief, she called her a filthy slut and a whore. she slashed her breasts and genitals because that's what made her a slut. so she couldnt stand it and just ran away. 

"what the fuck, why am i so upset over this? It's only a stupid idiot, that's all. i have no reason to be sad. 

Once Tenko finds out that he has the same power and in the same boat as felix, he withdrawls from his usual cheerful and serious state and becomes very depressed and confused. so he sits down on his bed and rocks back and forth, holding his head, saying "What am I? Am I real? Was I really born? am I even human?" Felix, watching from afar, hears his cries of confusion and sits down next to him and hugs him. "Tenko, please calm down," she says "I will help you understand." he looks at her. "Tenko, we were not exactly born this way. We are regular and normal humans. We are not monsters. But, these eyes have changed us so that we are different from normal people. In fact, as an indicator to show we were going to be chosen, we had some sort of marks on us. Yet, we were not born with these powers." "Why did we have these eyes? Why did we have to have those marks?" "Because something horrible or traumatic must have happened to each of us when we were young that had to deal with these eyes ... " "What do you mean?" "You know I am blind in my right eye, Tenko. You know it's because I got stabbed in the eye. And Ruofl is blind in the exact same eye. It's fate Tenko, the gods chose us this way. Ruofl showed me I was going to be chosen because I have snake eyes. Tenko, Lysto gave you poor vision even from birth to show you he would give you his eyes... the eyes of a fool. Something must have happened to you where Lysto deemed you worthy of recieving his power." "......my mother..." "I see. It is then that we became different from the rest..." "So ... what are we?" "You must understand, Tenko. You may call me the devil, I may call you the angel, but we are not such. Just because our fragile wings are of the nature, you must understand that we are neither angel or devil. We are but toys of the gods." "...what..?" "Tenko, you know taht your godly power shines when you think the battle is hopeless and lost. It is because Lysto will not stand for such sad circumstances. He wanted you to be happy. So he takes control of your body. As you know, I cannot die. Ruofl refuses to accept it. He decays and weakens, not destroys. So, he possesses me. You see that our bodies are just outlets for the gods."

"um, are you one of those crazy suicidal depressed people?"
"you're kiddingme, right? numbnuts. the last thing I want to ever do is die." he walks in front of tenko. "you only have one life. if it's so terrible then why not make it better? life... is... wonderful! sure, i am poor, sure, i live in a crummy abandoned appartment, but there are so many other things to think about !"
he walks around frantically. "and, when i get the chance, and i'm settled in and ready and i got a secure future, i'm ganna get married and have kids and be happy. there is no reason to let tragic things of the past get you down!"
he turns to tenko. "that's why you're a psephis, right? you wanted to protect others you love from people like me, people who killed your mom. see, you understand! you can't dwell on things that are over with! you only have one life!"

Raven finds out that felix killed Lisa just to piss off the Hisatsu from getting the necklace, and he chases felix and tenko in his lamborghini, almost smashing them along the way. felix speeds the fuck up but when he sees a turn in the road, he tries to put the breaks but they're broken. felix freezes, then hitches the helmet off of his head and gives it to tenko and says softly, "Please wear it, I'm getting ... a little hot in it." "felix --" "Please, please tenko, if raven catches up to us, please, I beg of you, hide, run, just don't let him touch you." they reach the turn, and they crash into a building. the music is off. tenko finds felix's bloody pile with his brains across the way, his motorcycle in a wreck. he stares in horror, but hears a car, turns around.. it's raven. he runs off, terrified, leaving the dead felix. he ends up back and illu hq and cries.

Felix slowly but surely finds himself falling in love with Tenko, in his male form... every time Tenko goes close to him, he blushes and tells him to go away. So later, he feels his emotions are going to burst, he gets a little too close to Tenko. He leans to kiss him but then backs away realizing what he's doing, and then runs away saying he has to do something. He starts cursing himself asking "What do I see in this man?..."

Tenko and Felix are staying at Felix's room at illuminati quarters for the night. Tenko's bed is right in front of the TV, and he's sitting in bed reading. Felix is sitting at the edge watching tv. after awhile Tenko sort of drifts off, and when he wakes up felix is staring into his face. tenko is more surprised than embarrassed, he quickly looks the other way to avoid the eye effects and he asks what felix is doing. felix says nothing but then whispers, "Tenko..."
Tenko cant help it but then looks into felix's eyes. he mentions, "When I look in his eyes... I get this knotted feeling in my stomach, as usual... but this time, it's not giving me a stomach ache... it's like... butterflies. c...could this be..?"
They stare at each other for awhile, and then they lean in to kiss. they're right at each other's lips until theres a loud noise on the tv. startled, felix jumps back. tenko muses for a minute and just thinks to himself "Did... did I almost just kiss a guy?"
He's like "What the fuck?" right now, and felix quickly says goodnight and goes to bed.
they dont speak of this moment in the morning afterwards and they're pretty awkward to each other.

alyson = kooters' girlfriend


those of the chosen eyes cant hurt each other. so doctor cant directly hurt felix with his power, kooters cant hurt doctor with holy, oya cant hit raven and etc. but they can still punch each other. The only way they can hurt each other is when they are in curse form.
blood window - ruofl
fool's bliss - lysto
carnage fist - tirth
unholy heart - cress
glass mind - arnia


Felix is really contemplating her feelings towards Tenko. She keeps telling herself they're friends only to beat the doctor, but when she thinks aloud, a girl member of illu comes in and shouts, "Hello, Felix! Welcome to the real world! YOU've got a crush on Tenko, but you're too afraid to say!"
"Oh shut UP! tenko is NOTHING a girl can want! I mean, he's big, and dumb, and stupid ..and ugly, and overprotective... and tall...and handsome.. and charming.. and smart.. and caring.. and strong.. and i.. ..oh tenko.. giggle~ sigh~"
she gives felix the ｬ_ｬ look
"Uh but yeah. I hate him. He's a real douchebag. I already gave you enough reasons why NOBODY would like him."


So once Alyson comes to stay at Felix's house, Chloe's jealousy becomes imminent and very clear. Whenever Tenko and Alyson smile at each other or hold hands, Felix glares and grips his fingers tight into a fist. One day he gets really pissed off at Alyson and he decides to get some revenge on her. So when Tenko and her are watching TV, Tenko asks if Felix can get them two bottles of water. Felix shrugs and says sure, and puts some poison into alyson's drink and marks it so he knows which one is his. He serves them and theyre too busy talking to get drinks. So Tenko, while not looking, grabs the poisoned one, and Felix sees this, so he yells Tenko's name before he gets poisoned and asks for him to coem to the kitchen. He makes up an excuse.
Reed says:
adding a shred of humor to the game
Reed says:
like
Reed says:
a cookie on the floor
Reed says:
she goes to pick it up
Reed says:
and then tenko screams "come to bed 8D"
Reed says:
and she goes
Reed says:
and a giant weight falls on the floor
Reed says:
and felix goes "ahh shit"



In one of the final battles with the hisatsu, after Felix loses her powers to doctor, raven finds it a perfect time to strike. Tenko steps in to save felix from the demise of Raven's powers. "I thought we were friends!" Tenko bursts, "You helped us in war! Do you really want it to come to this?" "This war is over," Raven snorts, "It proved nothing of our 'friendship'. As long as you're of the Illuminati, you're still our enemy!"
Tenko must beat raven, and finally he deals the finishing blow. Eouen, enraged, attacks Tenko, and severely wounds him. He's out for the battle and Felix saves him before Eouen kills him. Felix fights Eouen, and then damages her to a point where she is dying. She gives her final speech.
	"We... the proud Hisatsu... have given our everything to be the best..to not be in this poor, broken down place.. to live in a better place. we lived proud...and will die proud. but we will die poor..and die without our goals complete.
	We believed someday.. we would destroy you and all other insignificant weak rivals who stand in our path to our dreams. alas... it seems your values and dreams..you believed in more than us.
	I always thought my pain and sadness were magnified moreso than others and my dreams were so much more important than anything else..and we strived to make our hopes of becoming rich and famous true.. but we failed.. because we could not believe..
	My hopes of becoming important were fueled by Raven. he promised us he would give us anything if we could just believe, if we could stand up for ourselves. He encouraged us all to fight for ourselves and fight for our goals... if we just believed..."
	I found myself fighting more for raven than myself...my ambitions, all for raven... my goals for raven, my care for raven, my heart for raven... he had enraptured me with his ability to overcome obstacles and see the future for the hisatsu... the future he promised.
	but then.. i found now... that he himself could not believe after awhile.. and he only coached us because he did not want to see us suffer and lose faith like he did...but i too lost faith..and then we crumbled..like this.
	our goals were not complete. our dreams will never be finished. but..i will not die unhappy.. i will die with unmeasurable happiness.. because now i believe.. but i cant believe for myself or raven or the hisatsu.. i can believe in you.
	i know you can make this world better..i believe you can stop the doctor. so..felix...Tenko. as long as you believe, as you do now..you can do it all.
	you were a worthy opponent indeed....goodbye......"
eouen dies...


Arnia's six sense is definitely not just another empathetic "oh I know how you feel" type of thing. Because Arnia's senses are heightened to a point where no normal human could possibly stand, he can actually feel the emotions of others around him. He can tell if there is someone in the same room as him and how he feels without even looking at him. THis is because he is blind.


In a point where you got a really good score with Felix, she will get pissed at you for doing something wrong and fucking up. at that point she will walk away with another guy. you will have the choice to either let her go or stop her.
"That's what happens when you care about somebody! You get hurt!!" oya cries to tenko. "Do you love this woman or not? Speak! Or forever hold your peace!"
Tenko is caught in silence, with tears streaming.
"Think of the memories you and her shared. can you honestly say you love her and you want to be with her?"
ruofl appears. "Women are such delicate beings," he smirks. "You out of all people should know."
tenko with big round eyes thinks of everything they've done together. allt he memories and times they've been together.
"What is your decision?"
	-No... no... / -I can't stand it! I want her!
if you pick the second option, tenko will scream loudly and charge after felix and her boyfriend. he knocks the boyfriend over and takes hold of felix.
"Felix.. felix, you can't go away!"
"Right. Right!" Felix shouts angrily, "And what the fucka re you gonna say that's gonna make all the pain I feel go away, huh? What magic words are you gonna say?"
theres a pause
"I.. love you."


Felix really loves Tenko so she gives him a potato. "W...what? A potato? What is-" "I love my Kootiewootie," Felix says hugging him tightly
"I... er, love the potato, but.. what gave you this idea?"
"a flower is only good if it's dead. a standard rose gift is there to be beautiful and only lives for a short time. so its like saying 'my love for you is temporary and i love you only because you're hot'... but a potato! a potato lasts FOREVER! and if you leave it around, it even grows stuff on it! they dont rot! you can do so many things with a potato! they may be ugly but they're so useful! now THAT's like saying, 'i have so many ways to show that i love you and your looks dont matter to me because i'll still love you!'"
"..you really took that into consideration..."


"Whenever I say something about my girlfriend you just laugh... I don't expect you to care but... why?"
"Well, I just find it amuuuuusing... I am incapable of producing such infatuation for another human being, thus watching you hideously misguided people keep getting hurt by such a thing... is this "love" you speak of some sort of gambling game?"


Tenko leaves Felix [insert reason here], and she realizes she isn't wanted so she runs out into the pouring rain. Raven is walking on the street and sees her sitting on the corner of the sidewalk, crying. he sits down beside her and gives her the talk.
"So felix, you finally understand what it's like to love someone who isn't your family."
He takes out a knife.
"That's what happens when you care about somebody."
He drives the knife into his hand.
"You get hurt."
Felix stares. Raven stands up and gives her the appreciative noogie, and walks away.


Chloe's mother goes to the store to pick something up, and purposely leaves Chloe. Her father is sick in bed.
While Chloe is stranded on the streets, Ruofl hands her a knife so she can defend herself.
"This is a weapon you can use to protect yourself."
"Who are...you?"
"My name is Ruofl. I'm your guardian."
"What is...guardian?"
"It's a person who will take care of you."
"What about mommy? What about daddy? Can they be my guardians too?"
"Yes, they are."
"Let's go home then and show them to you!"
"I'm afraid that will be impossible... only you and a few other special people can see me."
"Why? Why Ruofl? Why can't mommy and daddy see you?"
"You're a special girl..."
	He stands up.
"You want to return to your house? Do you know the way?"
"No..no...no.."
"Then you must use this knife and fight your way to your goal..."
	He pauses.
"There are many bad people in this world, you know. If you don't fight, you'll die."
"But I dont... i don't..."
"You can stab the bad people with this knife. It is very sharp."
	She slides her finger downt he edge and cuts herself.
"Ah! It hurt... red..."
	Pause.
"What is this red stuff? Why does it come out?"
"That's your... life. If too much comes out, you die."
	She licks it.
"It tastes bad... why?"
"I'll fix that for you..."
	He lightly touches her and a wave of energy overcomes her.
"That should fix your taste. You should try agian."
	She licks her wound agian.
"It tastes good..like.. jelly!"
	She repeatedly slices herself to make more come out. Ruofl stops her.
"Now now, let's not let too much out. Bad things can happen. But it's okay if you do it to others."
"Y..yes!"


So..you can,... make zombies? Why can't the doctor?
	Because the doctor only has tirth's power...
well that's destruction, right? that means he should be able to make zombies, right?
	In a sense, he can make zombies. However, he only has the ingredients to make zombies. He needs to use those ingredients to make the cake, so to speak. and only I can make AND summon zombies.
So you aren't just randomly getting stuff out of the ground?
	I have to have suitable bodies to create zombies with. Only people with Ragnarok can make corpses suitable for 			ingredients to make zombies. Thus because the doctor only has Ragnarok, he only has the "ingredients". Using Dying Earth's power alone is like trying to make a cake without ingredients. You know how to do it, but you need the ingredients to finish. But because I have both Dying Earth AND Ragnarok, I can create ingredients for zombies and then make them.
So how does the doctor create zombies if he only has Ragnarok?
	I think he may be using catalysts of Dying Earth...
What do you mean?
	Well, for example: Certain books are catalysts of Ancient Moon, because they contain knowledge. If you use some of those books in your research or whatever, you can gain some of the abilities of Ancient Moon as long as you're using them correctly... So... If I got some, let's say, Holy Water... a catalyst of Spring... and I utilized it correctly by bringing out its power in a certain way, then I'll be able to use some of its abilities temporarily... like... Heal.
Ah, I see. The doctor is using catalysts to make zombies.
	Yes, that's what I think. There's no other way he can do it with just Ragnarok.
Then to stop them, we must destroy the catalyst.
	Right!


The first time Felix uses Psychic bomb, he shouts it just like an anime. After battle, Tenko asks why he shouts the name of the attack.
"So.. why do you shout Psychic Bomb? Do you have to?"
"Well... I never really thought about it... I dunno! Everybody does it in the movies. And it makes you look so much cooler and stronger. Just try it on one of your techniques! Watch the difference!"
	Felix silently puts a hand to the ground and uses a psychic bomb.
"That wasn't too impressive was it? NOW, watch how WAY cooler it gets when you do awesome body movements and shout the name of the skill!"
	Felix flails his arms around like in an anime and shouts "PSYCHIC BOMB!!" the blast blows up the ground.
"Seeeee? Wasn't that WAY cool? YOu should do it too!"


Chloe: Felix, I have to explain something.
Felix: W-who are you? What do you want from me? I don't believe in ghosts.
Chloe: I'm you.
Felix: Shut your trap! Tell the truth or I'll blast your head off!
Chloe: Hardheaded just like me. Hmm. You should know that hurting me will only hurt you.
Felix: Shut up! 
he slices the knife through her neck but it goes right through. his neck suddenly gets cut.
Felix: ahh..! ahhhhhh!!...ohh..err..!you.. you..!!
Chloe: will you listen now?
Felix: ...
Chloe: Felix, you don't really exist.
Felix: w..what?
Chloe: You are me.
Felix: tell the truth..who are you?
Chloe: I'm you. You were originally me. But to inherit Ruofl's power, I had to die to create you, since I was female. And females can't inherit the power...
Felix: .....
Chloe: Your thoughts and your experiences are influenced by me. That is why you have a feminine side to you, and that is why you can remember a past in which you yourself never lived through.
Felix: You're telling me... my thoughts, my feelings... my reactions and my decisions, they're all lies?
Chloe: In a less harsh way, yes.
Felix: ....so I dont exist.. at all.
Chloe: You exist because of the eye. 
Felix: So if ... ?
Chloe: I have been watching you. You must understand that if you value your life, then you must value your eye over any costs.
Felix: but..tenko--
Chloe: The feelings you have for that boy are only illustrated because I have feelings for him...you are just a living illusion.
Felix: I... will not be an outlet!! I'm real, and I exist. Look at me! I'm talking! I have my own thoughts! So just be quiet! I'm NOT a girl! I'm male. I don't love Tenko! So that means I'm not you! Just leave me alone!
Chloe: If you ever lose your eye, you understand you will give your life up to let me live inside that body again.
Felix: Leave!
Chloe: AS you wish.....

So Felix and Tenko run into a situation where felix's powers would be GREATLY appreciated. After Tenko finally finishes the task he asks Felix why he didn't use his powers.
"You know, Felix, that psychokinesis power of yours, that would have been reaaally helpful before I did that. Why didn't you do anything?"
"And you know, you obviously don't understand that I have consequences to do that shit. The requirement is BLOOD. You don't seem to get it that if I lose too much blood I'm going to PASS OUT and maybe even DIE. If I try to read minds the consequences are even greater."

Reed says:
and my other idea
Reed says:
is a part where tenko and felix are surrounded
Reed says:
then tenko gets KO'd and felix gets taken
Reed says:
its like one of those fights in final fantasy
Reed says:
where you have to lose the fight on purpose
Anni says:
oh those
Anni says:
LOL I hate those
Reed says:
and then felix is tied to a bed
Anni says:
I always use items
Anni says:
I HATE THAT HAHAHa
Anni says:
Go on
Reed says:
and they are planning on removing the blood window from him
Reed says:
so like
Reed says:
the doctor with the scalpel approaches him
Reed says:
and anesthetizes him
Reed says:
and then a part of the game is on felix's dream
Reed says:
where he remembers shit gone by, something to make the story even deeper
Reed says:
and then a flight of stairs
Anni says:
THEN RUOFL POPS OUT AND KICKS THE DOCTORS ASS
Reed says:
and he goes up
Anni says:
@#*!#@!
Anni says:
lol, go on
Reed says:
finds a translucid-like sprite
Reed says:
someone he held dear
Reed says:
and he is like "oimg, ur here i cant believe it"
Reed says:
and the person is like "you must wake up, your time has come to rise"
Reed says:
and then he does that
Reed says:
POPS OUT
Reed says:
AND WHAM
Reed says:
gunshots everywhere
Reed says:
and blood
Reed says:
and guts
Reed says:
etc etc
Reed says:
and then to make it funny
Reed says:
felix looks around
Reed says:
laughs
Reed says:
and leaves the room with a "how cliche"


"Oh... those girls?"
"Do you know anything about them?"
"Yeaaah, kind of."
"What? You must tell me! How come you did not say anything before?! We have to put this vile killer to justice!"
Felix scratches her face with the ^_^; face.
"Weeell, I didn't want you to get mad at me.. so..."
"What is it?! Come on now, speak up!"
"Oh, those girls ... I aaa.... I kinda sorta kidnap them, kill them and then have sex with their corpses..."
"W............................w.......WHAAaaaatht gfduajdaan fsdf?!1/1/1!"
"SEE! Now you're mad at me! I should have never told you!!!!!!!"

Tenko just finds out about Felix's nature - about how he kills the girls who show off their cleavage or stomach. He learns of this and starts to yell at him. "Okay then, if you really are no heretic, then how do you justify your actions by the watchful eye of God?"
"My actions... need no justification from God."
"What?!"
"Tenko, that is the utter fall of your perception of God... that you cannot understand that there are other ways to be acquainted with Him."
"You are saying what you did was right?"
"There is no good or bad in this world, Tenko... it is only based on what somebody understands through their eyes."
pause.
"I look to God... when I'm in troubled times. God shouldn't rule my life, because I rule my own life, and I play by my own rules. He shouldn't be the precedent of any justification because people do what they want. Not everybody sees the same vision as the Psephis do of God."


"Why do we fall in love...?"
"Because our weak human hearts allow us to..."

pope, cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, laypeople

A running gag in the game should include how big chloe's chest is.
1) In the middle of the night, Felix wakes tenko up because she had a disturbing dream. He wakes up with her chest in his face, and gives that drooling face. Felix gives the "..." face and then Tenko grabs her and starts shaking her, saying, "God damn it felix! If you don't want me to look at your cleavage then don't stick it in my face!!"
"WHAT? It's... not my fault my boobs are so big!"
2) Whenever Felix has to run down stairs, he yells "ow ow ow ow my boobs!" and then changes into a guy as he flies down the stairs.


While Arnia can see the truth in facts and knowledge, Lysto can see the truth in a person's soul, whether they are good or evil.



Some of Lysto's powers are too powerful of a force to exert through the body alone. A catalyst must be used for those. For Lysto himself, he uses his bear, Mr. Snuffleuppagus.

Lysto is unable to do anything by himself without his bear. Generally speaking, without his bear, Lysto is the weakest god of all. Because Lysto draws pain and suffering from humans and converts it as pure energy through the bear, his raw power is useless as he can't channel energy. The only reason Lysto can do anything such as heal or cure or bestow mercy on the dead is through his bear. Every time he uses a spell he removes negative energy from the human realm because he feeds on that energy for his own spells. Thus, because of this ability, he is the god of mercy but also the god of judgement due to the fact he can see one's true intentions in their soul.

Cress's body was so beautiful that he grew afraid of it and destroyed it...


girl felix says to tenko: What am i if not a slave to you humans?


AlchemistsAreHot: how cliche would it be
AlchemistsAreHot: if some girl is a robber and he robs this dude's house
AlchemistsAreHot: and he wakes up while she's doing it in the middle of the night
AlchemistsAreHot: and then he instantly falls in love with her after he sees her face ;x ?


tenko:
i was sitting on the couch, reading the newspaper, felix at my side. i figured i would let her relax a bit before we went out. i drifted my eyes over to the side, towards her. she was staring at me with this mystified look on her face. i shrugged it off and continued reading my newspaper. but sure enough a minute later, my eyes drifted once again. this time i put my newspaper down and asked, "what?"
"there is a monster on your face," she said.
"i-i'm sorry?"
her arm reached out towards my face. she extended a finger and softly slid it down the side of my face. my cheeks turned pink. her finger reached my chin, and she jerked her hand back as she made a sort of "ah" noise.
"it's prickly..." she said, frowning.
my hand rubbed my chin. she was talking about my facial hair.
"er... you mean my chin."
"why do you let the furry monster stay?" she asked quizzically.
"It's not a monster, felix --" i said, rubbing the back of my head "-- it's just my goatee."
"goat?" she tilted her head slightly, "a goat? a goat is a strange animal, is it not?"
"goatee. Goa-tee. it's what men get when they don't shave."
she seemed puzzled. but she didn't say anything more. i couldn't tell if she liked it or not.


"Oh! Skullfucking... when you drill a hole into the girl's head, big enough for your johnny... and then you stick your snake in there... and... and....... graaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr!!!!!"
"It'ssssssssssss making me wanna blow my load everywhere! Aww. Is there a gullable girl around anywhere?"
"Shut your trap you noisy bugger, that is some sick shit!"



Oya shows some pictures of Felix when he was young.
"This is when you were about fifteen, do you remember that far back?"
"Ummmm.. hmmmm..." Felix thinks, "Nope. Nope. Nope."
"Even I can't remember when I was fifteen," Tenko scrunches up his face, "How old are you Felix?"
"I'm ... I'm .... ah.... uhh..." Felix tries to count on his fingers, "Err, uhh.. I'mmmm..."
"Let's see," Oya thinks, and puts on a thinking face. "You're 21, I think."
"Yeah! I'm 21."
	Tenko puts on a "what?" face.
"How in god's name does somebody not even know how OLD they are?" Tenko says, disgusted.


As a joke there should be a cooking minigame to play since both Tenko nor Felix can cook for shit. Ingredients are found when you kill certain enemies, and its stuff like "brains" 'intestines' and etc. 



At a bar, Felix is facing Tenko and he has his back to two big deprived guys. Felix has a slender, girlish figure, so it's hard to tell if he is a boy or not when you look at him from the back. The two wolfwhistle at him and say stupid stuff like "Come to my hotel room tonight!" Felix whirls around, confused, and the two guys gasp and are like "AHHH IT'S A TRAP!!" Tenko sits there, with his eyes closed, sipping his tea, and mutters, "...Pathetic."



-Felix: -Attempts to open door, fails- GODDAMNIT! Tenko: -Breaks it down with ease- Felix: Show off.	
Tenko: -Holds interrogatee over building- Tell me what I need to know before you end up all over the morning news.
Tenko: -Kills someone with teacup (MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!!)-
-Tenko: -Cuts down power to place, puts on night-vision, breaches place of power loss-
-Tenko: Faggot? -Hurricane kicks into wall-

Xeharax: Tracing circles with his claw on Tenko's six pack. :x
Xeharax: I also got one of E Felix like dragging a finger up tenko's leg, then at button of his pants like cutting it with a claw.

Xeharax: Evil Felix vs. Tenko
Xeharax: Oooh what a battle. <3
Xeharax: Evil Felix should try to seduce Tenko. :x
AlchemistsAreHot: that would be HOOOOTTTTTTT@!!!!!!!!111
Xeharax: Yeah
Xeharax: I go the image of evil Felix like getting all close to Tenko
Xeharax: Tenko's just like: "..."
Xeharax: And E Felix has like a claw dragging along his cheek, such a tease. :x


Xeharax: You need to have Tenko call Felix a "cheeky bastard"
AlchemistsAreHot: HHAHAHa
AlchemistsAreHot: WTF XD where did this come up?
Xeharax: Call of Duty 4. Brit dude called one of his guys "cheeky bastard". xD
Xeharax: I was like: "... TENKO!!!!"


Xeharax: NOTES:
Felix: At some point must say "fuck-a-doodle-doo".
Also note: Quid is another word for cigarette. Quid and fag lol.
Tenko must make a rant where a majority of the of rant is made up of the f-bomb.
Make Tenko's wife like that annoying bitch girlfriend of Shaun's.


PUT FELIX ON A LEASH


"I had a great time tonight... I hope we can see each other again, I really like you... Would you mind if I kissed you?"

Felix: "What's this feeling.... it's so surreal. Is it love for real? Am I capable of such human emotions? ... It isn't like the movies at all... why do they make this so easy? Is this love...?"


Vertigrow: WALL MONSTER!!! GROWS OUT OF WALL!

ZOMBIE HUMP!!-special attack

Allen: Were you saying foul words to a LADY?
felix: no D:
allen: *WHIP*


Alyson: ALLEN GET ME DOWN!!
Allen: I'M WORKING ON IT BITCH!!

Felix and Allen separate, and Felix gets stuck with Alyson...

Cheddarmancer: Oh god
Cheddarmancer: I just thougght of something funny. xD
Cheddarmancer: For Allen
Cheddarmancer: Throw in a rape Alyson special
Cheddarmancer: Like  Kratos. xD
Cheddarmancer: He'll get exp.


ZOMBIE CHILDREN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Felix catches some guy he was looking for, ties him up so he cant move.
"Okay! Now, I have my fun. Let's play hangman!"
	he giggles.
"Guess my name and I'll let you live. Gimme a letter!"
"...A"
	he chops off the guy's feet.
"Sorry, wrong!"


FELIX: Why can't we do the stuff that lovers usually do??!
ALLEN: I'm not your lover.
FELIX: You sure as hell act like it.
	with this, Allen immediately bends over and starts making out with Felix.


Allen and Felix have some really intense sex, and the doorbell rings. Allen stops, gets on a bathrobe, and heads downstairs with a very satisfied look on his face, leaving a dazed Felix sitting on the bed, swooning.

After sex, Allen and Felix get to get some post-sex food... cold leftover ribs from the fridge.



A: "If you're so bent on taking over the world, why are you focusing on the hard part first instead of the easy part? Taking over weak minds of the masses is easier to begin with than destroying us Carriers first."
V: "...Ruling the world? Ha.. ha ha ha ha! Haha ha! Don't make me laugh!"
F: "Isn't that what you faggots want to do? Take over the world, like every other villain out there?"
V: "Pff... if I wanted to, I could rule the world by myself, right now. I could kill every human who opposes me, and I could make all filthy humans my slaves. Do you think we want to do that?"
A: "That's the vibe you've been giving off."
V: "No, worm. We want to destroy the gods."
F: "Why!"
V: "With destruction, comes creation. You understand killing a god destroys everything he created, don't you?"
F: "yeah?"
V: "Why not destroy all gods and create a new life? Doesn't that sound wonderful?'
F: "You're fucking sick! Why would you wanna kill everything you've known? Even yourselves?!"
V: "Because this world is disgusting! It disgusts me! Disgusting humans everywhere! Those cocky gods rule on their polished thrones, doing nothing day by day! While we slave to find our own purpose, exiled by our own wish! A renewed world ungoverned by those gods is the only thing we want."


F: "Do you know what love is? It's giving someone your bleeding human heart and trusting them enough not to crush it between their hands like a toy. This is a trust, ... a kindness I have never found in this world for as long as I've been alive. I have never trusted anyone enough. I have never given that "heart" to anyone because I don't have it anymore!"


"HMMM... That's strange... I don't remember inviting any DEMONS to this party...."

BEHOLD I AM HERE!

Old man? xD "Hey old man, what can you tell me about fighting the 'narccasistic looking dude with dolls on his back'?"

"... France!? Only frogs come from france."




Kinos: Instead of walking, he floats like Chloe. Many of his attacks include being niggaspdhax.exe fast, and bats. He is silent so it is hard to detect where he is if it teleports and does not immediately attack. His scarf is a key in his defense tactics but can also be used as attacking.

WAYS TO ASK ALLEN IF HE WANTS TO DO IT:
-Straight up: "Allen, wanna fuck?"
-Poetic: "Allen, would you like to exchange body heat with me in the passion of the night?"
-Romantic: "Allen, let's share sweet whispers as we make love."
-Cute: "Allen... you wanna... put that... in me?"




"Dear God, please see me and Allen safely through our journey. I know I don't give a shit about anything but Illuminati or you..."
	Allen softly leans on the doorway, listening.
"...but please let Allen be okay. He is my friend and I really care about him. Please take care of him..."
"Who are you talking to?" Allen suddenly interrupts.
	Startled, Felix looks over to see Allen standing at the doorway. He growls at him.
"What the fuck are you doing, bothering me like that? Mon dieu! Can't you take your fat somewhere else?"
"I couldn't help but be intrigued at your schizophrenia."
	Felix narrows his eyes in anger.
"I was praying."
"Praying?" Allen thinks mockingly, "Who is there to pray for? We already know what gods there are, and they certainly aren't ones to pray to."
	Felix pouts.
"Anyway, what are you still doing here!? Will you just fuck off?!"
	Allen shrugs, and exits. Felix continues praying.
"...I know you're out there listening somewhere, so please help us. Thank you..."



Allen and Felix are having sex, but repeatedly Felix keeps saying no no stop stop. Allen reponds with, "What's wrong, you don't like it? The sounds you're making are telling me otherwise."


"Allen?" Felix asks.
	Allen turns his head to Felix, with a facial expression that silently asks What?
"Is there ever a place you wanted to be, other than London?"
"What kind of question is that?" Allen thinks.
	A moment of silence, and Allen reclines.
"I've always wanted to visit America."
"A..America!! Why would you want to go to that filthy place?! It's full of... Americans!!"
"Well, you hear so many things of the country, so it sounds intriguing."
"..... Is that all?"
	Silence.
"I've been ... thinking of Paris."
"..?!"
"




"So uhh.. are you really just a bunch of 20-something year old white guys?"
"Hahaha!!! You really think so?"
"What?"
"Of course, these aren't really our 'true forms'... they're just images that we like, so we use them."
"So what are your 'true forms?"
"Hmm.. you really want to know?"
"Yeah."
"Well, that's too bad. We don't have any."
"What?"
"We don't have any form. We're just sentient spirits. We can make any form we want."
"So you're... nothing?"
"That's right. I can be man, woman, child, beast.. anything. We change our forms every thousand years or so."
"Umm... Seriously?"
"Yeah, I'm genderless!"

Allen is cooking dinner, and Felix asks to try a piece. Allen is about to feed it to him via fork, and Felix is about to gulp it, but Cecil grabs the fork at the last minute and eats the food himself.
"Sorry, but that's not a good idea. Felix has a special diet he needs to stick to, so I don't suggest you feed him any food. Mmm.. good cooking, by the way."
	Allen blinks. Felix gets angry.
"Oh, come on, pops! That was only one time!"
"I'm sure. Remember the time you tried cheese?"
"Yeah..."
"And the time you stole Philia's chicken?"
".....Yeah."
"And remember the time you ate that pizza we ordered?"
"..........OK, give me a break! All that was probably just bad food."
"Then why did the rest of us not get sick?"
"It was a conspiracy!"
"...Listen, you know what you can't eat, don't try eating anything else because I'm tired of cleaning up your vomit!"
"HEY, nobody told you that you HAD to do it!"
"Well I do it because I know nobody else WILL! It's bloody disgusting!"
"I haven't gotten sick in a LOOOOONG time!"
"Good. So keep it that way!"

ALTERNATE SITUATION: Felix has awoken from sleep/being passed out, and he's sitting at the kitchen table waking up while Allen is cooking next to him.
"Uhh..hhh... ah.. so hungry..."
"Here. Try this."
	Allen finishes what he's cooking, eggs, slides it onto a plate. He takes off some of the egg with a fork and sticks it to Felix's mouth. Felix looks at him with wide-eyes.
"A..Allen! You're really going to feed me people food?" he says excitedly.
"People food?" Allen thinks.
"Here, let me taste it!"
	Felix leans over to gulp, but from nowhere Cecil comes in, pushes his face over, and eats the egg himself. He chews for a moment, then gulps it down.
"Sorry, but that's not a good idea. Felix has a special diet he needs to stick to, so I don't suggest you feed him any food. Mmm! By the way, that was delicious."




Allen is cooking dinner (again) because he is hungry. Felix looks at what he is making. It's something very simple, like canned peas with linguine. Felix, used to the luxury of theft and Illuminati's profitable investments, instantly makes a theory.
"Pops told me that linguine was poor people food. So does that mean, Allen ... ?"





NOTABLE CECIL WISDOM QUOTES:

"Pops... why do we fall in love...?"
"Because our weak human hearts allow us to."

"Allen, let go of yourself. Showing emotions does not mean you are weak. It means you are still human."

"I don't think that any one person can say that another "deserves" to die. We don't have that authority over each other."

"No one is perfect, Allen. But in the end, we are all nobodies. Therefore, we're all perfect. Silly, isn't it?"

"You think things will be fixed by themselves? -chuckle- Think again."

"Allen. It's better to fight FOR something, instead of against something."

"Ahhhh, Allen! If you keep frowning like that, it'll stick like that your entire life. Cheer up a little!"

"Allennnnnnnnnn. The world doesn't change itself, you know. You've got to be the one who spins it around. Every step we take changes the future by a fraction more."





FELIXQUOTE: "I would never hit a girl. I would just cut her apart."

"I lost my job, my home, my money... the only thing I have left is my family, the only thing that makes me happy. And you want to take that away from me just because I love them?..."
"Yeah, I do."











(12:11:52 AM) Anni: i was thinking of making BW enjoyable by two people
(12:11:54 AM) Anni: LOM style
(12:12:16 AM) Anni: except i think the AI configuration would go into way more detail in the light that there is no 2p
(12:12:35 AM) Anni: obviously thered be ones like "stay the hell away" and "attack everything in sight" and "use all your fucking mana"
(12:12:55 AM) Anni: but perhaps go into more detail
(12:13:04 AM) Anni: attack monsters less or greater than your level
(12:13:12 AM) Anni: only use mana if above X amount or less, etc
(12:13:30 AM) Anni: like your own personal assistant you dont have to rely on the obvious AI for
(12:13:45 AM) Anni: it'd be like programming a monster X_X
(12:14:06 AM) Anni: but even still, with 2p support i imagine it'd make it more fun
(12:14:10 AM) Anni: if some guy wants to play with his friend
(12:14:15 AM) Anni: go right a fucking head
(12:14:41 AM) Anni: but then thered have to be the menu thing..
(12:14:48 AM) Anni: items are shared so thats okay
(12:14:50 AM) Anni: but
(12:15:12 AM) Anni: using skills and such is a different matter
(12:15:32 AM) Anni: anything else like equipment and status and etc would also be shared and accessed under one start menu
(12:15:48 AM) Anni: using skills in battle would obviously need two unique situations
(12:16:01 AM) Anni: but that means two different hotkey sets for each person
(12:16:05 AM) Anni: in 2p anyway
(12:16:09 AM) Anni: 1p only needs one obviously
(12:16:26 AM) Anni: hmmm... that also means the amount of monsters should be way more
(12:16:32 AM) Anni: but there's also room for co-op stuff!
(12:16:48 AM) Anni: also 1p should be able to switch from which guy they want to play
(12:17:12 AM) Anni: if you cant bust through the door, have your friend do it instead godamnit
(12:17:25 AM) Anni: anyway, that much i know as of right nwo
(12:17:36 AM) Anni: speaking lom though i was also thinking of
(12:17:42 AM) Anni: its forging/compounding system
(12:17:53 AM) Anni: i dont want to STEAL from it but its actually pretty goddamn fun
(12:18:10 AM) Anni: actually, now that i think about it, it's more like a combination of RO and legend of mana really
(12:18:33 AM) Anni: some itenz that drop from monsters can be compounded via forging to do sweet shit
(12:18:44 AM) Anni: like justin's sword i just got has a chance to lower def of a monster on attack
(12:18:58 AM) Anni: now if you can choose whether to compound that stuff on i think it'd be super cool to customize a weapon that way
(12:19:08 AM) Anni: thats what i always liked about that in LOM
(12:19:20 AM) Anni: but monsters would have special ones i think
(12:19:34 AM) Anni: monsters themselves would drop some generic thing called soul crystals
(12:19:41 AM) Anni: and each monster has a different effect
(12:19:45 AM) Anni: so it's kind of like RO with cards
(12:19:48 AM) Anni: except it's not cards
(12:19:55 AM) Anni: because putting cards on a weapon is dumb
(12:20:13 AM) Anni: but there's other useless items that monsters drop other than their souls that can augment a weapon too obviously
(12:20:29 AM) Anni: armour is a different story
(12:20:58 AM) Anni: should everything affect all types of equipment or just certain itenz affect certain equipments just like RO?
(12:21:05 AM) Anni: itd give way to lots more customization in the former but
(12:21:13 AM) Anni: more work thinking what that shit does 
(12:21:37 AM) Anni: but giving your weapon status effects is the shit



"Yeah, well, life's a bitch, so what can you do about it?"
"Yeah, well, life ain't a bitch. You just call her a bitch 'cuz she won't give you any pussy."



Felix should be taking a walk at night and he spots a robber trying to lockpick into a house. He watches with amusement before finally saying something...
"What are you doing?"
The thief, a lady, immediately turns around to see a perching Felix on a wall. She points a gun at him in reflex, but her eyes slightly widen as she sees he's just a boy. "It's a kid..." she thinks, and lowers the gun, but still is on guard. Felix grins and drops down from his perch, starting to walk towards the lady.
"You honestly think you're getting anywhere like that?"
"W..what do you know!? Who are you?!"
"Hah. I knew you were an amateur from the very second I started watching you."
	He walks up to the door and gestures towards it.
"You're doing it wrong. Watch and learn."
	He bends over and takes out his own lockpicking tools, and proceeds to unlock the door within only a few seconds. He stands up and puts his tools away, and faces the thief.
"The trick I use is to close my eyes. It lets me hear the pin drops easier."
	The thief stares in awe/confusion.
"Uh... you aren't ... just a kid, are you..?"
"I am."
	He flips open a balasong.
"But now that you know how I do it, I'm going to cut open your throat."
"W-what?!"
	He lunges at her, holding her down with his schiavi, and stares with a psychotic grin.
"You thought I was just being nice?"
	He stabs her multiple times.
"Of course not. I planned to murder you all along. I just wanted to see your reaction."




THE PRINCESS OF DISTRESS
The young princess of Anceknight, Idia, has always been very quiet and shy. Her valkyrie handmaiden, Kakari, is faithful and loyal to her, but seems outwardly aloof and ignores rumours about the princess. Kakari is the princess's only friend, and if anyone even genuinely wants to befriend the princess, Idia deliberately pushes them away, leaving her isolated from the world. She hides in her castle all day and very rarely goes outside, if she does then she hides behind Kakari for protection.
