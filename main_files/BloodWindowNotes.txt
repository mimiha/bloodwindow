*Falsetto should be used on the chapter when you find out felix can turn into a girl. Falsetto means that a male can reach the pitch of a female by certain vocal chords.
*Contralto is the lowest voice of a female. This should be used in a chapter that deals a lot with Alyson, playing on both terms of the word 'low', because she is scum of the earth.
*Legato means the piece is to be played smoothly.
*Glissando is when you slide between two notes. It should be in a chapter with a lot of geminis.
*Intermezzo is when you connect main points of the composition. It should be as a chapter when EVERYTHING comes together about alex, felix, and chloe.
*Etude is A musical composition written solely to improve technique. Should be used when someone is practicing their powers.
*Tremolo is quick repetition of the same note or the rapid alternation between two notes. Use when a chapter is based on only two alternating characters, i.e Seras and Argus.
