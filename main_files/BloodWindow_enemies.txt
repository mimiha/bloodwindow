			Blood Window Enemy List (Incomplete!!!!!!11!)



=================WRETCHED ENEMIES

	Feres:
-AIs (Angelic Inferiors): Robotic enemies manufactured and modeled after angels. Default enemy under Feres. Being underneath Feres's control, this makes them the strongest of the default enemies in BW.
-Forsaken Knights: Think of Allen's Forsaken Knight class and imagine an army of these underneath Feres's control. Special forces. Makes for big trouble against both Allen and Felix.
-Lentemuli: Little girls created from slime. Ew? They come up, grab, and beat the fuck out of you. Oh and they try to pull you into them as well, so you may be trapped forever and ever... or at least until you select "continue".
-Barracuda: Giant slime monster made up of the Lentemuli. A mini boss under Feres. His pet, his creation.
-Rudo, Renald, and Rath: Three brothers. Captains of the Forsaken Knights. Mini bosses under Feres. Rudolph is a lancer and also wields a bow, making him the ranged fighter of the three. His attacks are fast but the weakest of the three. Renald fights with a claymore and tower shield, making him the tank of the group (IE damaging him WILL be a bitch). Rath wields two heavy axes, making him the berserker of the group. Attacking him from afar is your best bet. (More info to come.)



	Seras:
-Garuda: Harpies with the element of ice under their command. Usually stay airborne, they only come down at quick strikes to deal damage. Another attack is also whipping blades of ice down at you. Usually utilize the help of sirens in their attack. They are male.
-Dirguiems: Glowing blue beings that take the form of young beautiful women. They have the ability to stun you with their singing, with the addition of the ability of freezing your character in place. While physically impaired, they rely on their harpie allies to finish you off in your frozen/stunned state.
-Ice Golem: The inevitable golem monster, present in all ice places.
-Skye: Ice birds. They are as big as vultures, but they are made entirely of ice.
Lancelot and Guenevier: "The Forbiden Lovers". Mini bosses under Seras. Lancelot is a harpie while Guenevier is a siren. Both are lovers as the title given to them claims. Lancelot is the champion of the volacials while Guenevier is the queen of the dirguiems. Their strategy is simple: Guenevier stuns or feezes you in place, while Lancelot comes in for the finishing blow. Of course they'll have their own unique set of attacks and such. Working on that later. 
Note: Lancelot must be like Merco.




	Valis:
-Blade Wenches: Puppets of girls designed by Valis. They are possesed by the souls of murdered virgins. Each puppet carries a pair of giant sheers, all with the intention of severing Allen's and Felix's penises from their bodies (no joke lul). Slow, but does massive damage on impact. (Design for them should include a chastity belt xD).
-Guillotines: They are basically Blade Wenches, only one difference: their hands have been replaced with blades on chains. Made for range.
-Nusciso: Water in the shape of a young boy. Being a shapeshifter, he can take the form of whatever he feels neccessary to destroy you. He can shape weapons and such out of water.
-Bloody Mary: Mini boss under Valis. The deadliest of his Blade Wench creations. Bloody Mary has several blades sticking out of her body, which she can pull out to use in close combat. Her ranged moves will be chains with guillotines that are also attatched to her body. They extend out and target Allen and Felix.




	Kinos:
-Phantoms: The souls of the departed that have been recycled by Kinos. They act as his servants, ready to answer his call at any given time. They are much like their master, able vanish from view. Their tactic is to vanish then reappear when ready to deal the finishing blow to Allen or Felix. Attack in groups. Few will hold you down while one is free to do what they want with you. Being shadows, it would appear that they are never ending.
-Whispers: Purely invisible demons. Can't hear them, they are only semi transparent. Spot em quick and take em out before they take you out.
-Noxii (sing. Noxus): Bats. Vampiric bats. They can be seen flying around in little packs. When you get close to them, they swarm you and furriously drain your HP. Not only that, but there's a slight chance of your character falling asleep. The only way to avoid these nocturnal fiends is to find your way into the light. If playing as Allen, you may utilize light spells against them.
-Jack the Ripper: Mini boss under Kinos. The soul of the infamous killer, kept by Kinos for years. Corrupted and turned into one of his servants, probably the most powerful phantom at his command. Jack is pretty much like a regular phantom, only harder to kill. Also unlike other phantoms, he comes with two hidden sickles and a grand scythe for heavy damage. Strictly close range based.


	

	Argus:
-Army of the Dead: Zombies trained to be like soldiers. Armored and given weapons. They serve Argus in vast, seemingly unlimited legions. Flame property has been added to their attacks.
-Scale Lords: Lizard-men demons. The real soldiers of Argus's army. They're much like raptors and hunt in packs. They're equipt with curved blades and shields, but their real strength lies in their ability to fight in packs.
-Mevil: Argus's pyromancer unit. Follows Shin around and casts spells.
-Shin: Argus's frenzy knight unit. Protects Mevil.
-Barghest: Hell hounds. Fire demon dogs that shoot out fire. Simple, but effective. Hunt in packs, can also be found with riders on them (these are fairly big dogs).
-Singesever: Basically Ceberus, the three headed hound who guards the gates of the underworld. Why the fuck not? xD Mini boss under Argus and his pet no less. He's much like three barghest in one. Each head has the ability to shoot out balls of fire and, when they howl fire juts up from the ground. Get too close, and each head will take a limb. Needless to say, game over.







=================SUBCONSCIOUSNESS ENEMIES
These are ones you might find in the characters' dreams, or flashbacks.


	Allen:
-Husky: Big man. Punches you. Wears a messed up abstract cop uniform. Slouches. Abstract of his dad.
-Dipuc: Backwards version of cupid. Has anything to do with anti-love. Foil of Allen and Alyson's relationship. The annoying, ranged, flying enemy of his subconsciousness.
-Hairball: Cute little cat. Silver. Red eye and blue eye. Felix? o.o
-Succubus: Demon that takes form of a whore, basically. Her ability is to charm the player. Basically when player tries to damage Succubus when charmed, they end up damaging themselves. Also Succubus can claw player to death.
-Innocent Ivory: First boss of Allen's subconsciousness.




	Felix/Chloe:
-Princess: Stereotypical cheerleader: blonde, busty, annoying as fuck.
-Wormhole: Basically a big blackhole. Get sucked in, you randomly end up some place in the map and take damage. They actually do move around.
-Ira: Angry little girl who has both hands chained to a large metal statue/sculpture that she drags behind her. To attack, she swings it around at you, and easily causes knockback. The statue is unfinished, but it is a disturbing image of someone in agony.
-Flesh Sculpture: Abominations that can withstand alot of damage. You must blow off most of their body in order to destroy them.
-The Hanging Tree: First boss of Felix's subconsciousness.





=================GODS ENEMIES

	Lysto:
-Valkyries: Female warriors under the command of Lysto. They uphold justice and lunge at the chance to strike at evil. Not to be underestimated, at all. Their beautiful wings make them fast, and capable of flight.
-Valkyrian Cavalry: Valkyries on winged horses. Fast, hunt in packs, and WILL stampede you when given the chance. Best to take them out from afar.
-Odin: Mini boss under Lysto. The commander of the Lysto's forces. The strongest warrior under his employ. He's much like Renald (Feres's captain). The only difference is in place of a claymore, Odin wields a heavy war hammer. Deals significant damage, while being a tank all to himself. Not to be taken lightly.
-Nelus: Faerie servants of Lysto. Virtually weak and useless. They act as a support for Vagus. If cornered, they can swarm the player.
-Vagus: Fucking parasitic plant. Feeds off the Nelus that follow it. It eats one to get stronger + heal itself.




	Tirth:
-Deobovis: A cow-like creature... with a scythe. xD "Wtf! I can't even make a COW without it wanting to kill someone! ><"
-Arcesso: A necromancer unit. Servants of Tirth. Not much more be needed to say. They summon skeletons known as Infiral. Can also summon Borros, undead animals made out of bones (looks like the Skull Beast from Legend of Mana).
-Dainslaif: Cursed sword brought to life to kill you. It is flaming and can easily burn you.
-Efreeti: Fiery men/women, just torsos. Use fire spells.
-Wraith: Skeletal flying reaper enemy. Has a scythe.




	Ruofl:
-Oculis: An eyeball creature that turns you to stone at it's gaze (stoner XD). Think of the creepy eyeballs, Evil Eyes, from Everquest 2.
-Fericat: A cat-creature, pets of Ruofl. They are vicious creatures with the strength of a lion, ferocity of a tiger, speed of a cheetah, and agility of a leopard. Like their master, they have wings and can take flight. Usually found to be sleeping. Disturb it, be prepared for a hell of a fight on your hands.
-Ginger: Little girl enemy. Takes shape of a doll until you get close. Turns into little girl demon. Doll is her companion. Can act as a pet and protect her, or she can melee you with it. (Dunno how you want it, Jen).
-Vertigrows: Spider-women creatures. Hang from the ceiling and come down snatch you. When ensnared, you take significant DPS, chance of being poisoned.
-Harynx: A pair of arms and hands that come out of the wall. One grabs you while the other beats the crap out of you... or they both do that. xD




	Arnia:
-Adepts: Casters of magic, especially anima magic. Powerfull spells but weak physical fitness. Your average caster.
-Nequams: Creatures of fire, ice, and thunder. Summoned by adepts to battle you. Their pets, basically.
-Viriac: A bodiless suit of armor, brought to life by magic. The main heavy hitters of Arnia.
-Tome of Enchantment: A magical flying book. Casts spells (used by Seras and Arnia).
-Tome of Discernment: Another magical flying book, stronger than its counter part. Casts holy spells like that of Allen's.
-Merlin: Mini boss under Arnia. The famous wizard we all know about. It goes without saying that when you're fighting this boss, you're fighting the most powerful caster in the game. Be prepared to keep hauling your ass every which way in attempts to avoid the spells thrown at you.





	Cress:
-Skara: Beheaded female angels. Basically. They're very quick and excell in hand to hand combat. Don't go for headshots when taking on these enemies. You'll regret it.
-Abvultus: Lifeless corpse that's just a torso, but have arms jutting out of their backs. They move about by hanging onto things. They hang on to the ceiling, when idle, seemingly lifeless. Then you get close, they twitch, and you better back off.
-Stalagmite: Earthy statues brought to life. Several end up being dismembered, missing a limb or two in combat. Though slow, they ARE powerful. One strike from this golem is sure to deliver heavy damage.
-Grell: A squid-like creature that lurks in rivers and other bodies of water. A cycloptic squid.
-Censored Seraph: Crazy angel that can't speak or see. Has 4 arms and basically tries to destroy you. Low accuracy, but hits HARD.
-Dr. Jekyll/ Mr. Hyde: A hideous ogre who serves Cress. He's both fast and strong, making him a fair berserker in battle. Get him to revert back to his original state to hit him for massive damage.








=================UNCATEGORIZED MINIBOSSES/BOSSES

-Hey Old Man: Our favorite guide, possesed by a demon... or he might be drunk. Who knows with the old man? >.> Quick and strong fighter. While not able to possess magical ability, his physical ability is rather high. Able to match Felix and Allen (shock o.o). Defeat him by forcing him to drink! Till he passes out. xD Bonus boss, for sure.

-Giant Felix Doll: A giant posessed doll of Allen's lover. Haunts him in his sleep. This doll posesses shadow magic, however he is virtually weaker than Felix and much slower. However his size allows him to do a great deal of damage upon impact. :x Bonus boss. xD

-The Demons: Demonic band that catches Felix and Allen while they're drunk. Bonus boss AND possibly a regular boss. Bonus mission: defeat The Demons in a state of drunkedness. :3 Bonus item: Infinite drinking flask.

-Felix: Ah yes. Felix. Our feline-fiendish-friend. One of the characters you get to play as, but you will be fighting him for the first part of the game. Reoccuring fights with him. Think like the fights in Devil May Cry 3 with Dante and vergil.

-The Doctor: Mr. Tristan Lynch. Tirth's carrier. Able to wield the element of fire. Fire based attacks. Can also summon zombies and Waterline employees to his aid. Zombies he summons will be berserkers. 

-The Doctor's Apprentice: Alexander Wound. While not being able to utilize any sort of elemental or magical ability, he is not completely helpless. He's just as agile as Felix, and just as handy with a blade. He also comes with suture-scissors which serve as a throwing weapon for him. Get to close and he will latch onto you, injecting you with a vile to slow you down and eventually put you to sleep. Once you're asleep, it's gameover.

-Pluvia: A girl who sits on a cloud. She attacks you with wind and rain.

-Iriwarx: Skeletal snake.

-Duerze: Six-eyed tentacle monster... wtf Jen. xD It grabs the player and chokes them to death. :D Often reffered to as Cecil's pet. xD

-Incubus: Demon that takes form of a trench-coat rapist. Handsome, he confuses the player about their sexuality. When in this confused state, the player has a chance of not being able to attack. Incubus also comes with a knife for melee damage.

-Bistec: Big fucking huge chunk of meat. Defeating it and eating it regains HP.

-Cacophonos: Singing creature?
