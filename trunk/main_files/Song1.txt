La Solitude du Coeur
Loneliness of the heart

I reach my arm out to you
Brushing the hair from your face
I feel maggots crawl through your heart
and rest themselves on me

I know you don't love me
You're a rotting, pus-filled soul
Once a human, just like me
I'll restore your emotions for you



Chorus:

This feeling in my chest
Breaking, shaking, shattering
I can't escape

My heart is slowly sinking low.
A decaying piece of garbage
You wither like a tree in winter



In the dead of night
I drive out that organ that harms us both
Beating mine with blood spraying
Tossing yours with maggots inside

I know you still don't love me
You still sit slumped in your chair
Once a human, just like me
I'll restore your emotions for you

*Chorus

A brand new day is beginning for us
You love me now and I am thrilled
Our passionate night was never better
but the worms in your flesh tickled


The stench perfumes our bed
Shall I toss you under like the rest?
