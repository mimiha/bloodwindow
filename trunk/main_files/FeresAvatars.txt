Stultz, Ryzel, and Kischkel

They were once the Angel Creeps who served under Feres's avataral group, but when these three Angels were sent to try to destroy Tristan, he instead captured them and conducted experiments on them, and in turn he fucked them up badly. 
With Alex doing reworking on their brains, they did some pretty messed up things: Stultz is near-braindead, Kischkel is partially insane and Ryzel is bipolar. While Ryzel is the only one who doesn't have the severity of brain damage like Kischkel and Stultz, she has a chip implanted in her head which blows up on command if she doesn't follow orders. Even if it blows up, she still lives, because Tristan can just keep 'fixing' her.
The only way to kill these Angel Creeps is to blow off their pin wings.

To Tenko and Felix, they are just really sad zombie-like beings who the doctor is cruelly using as puppets, just like his own zombies. They don't like to attack them because they are so pathetic, but they have to get out of the way. No matter how many times they get blown up, limbs torn off and whatnot, they can always be re-fixed (read: Nana from Elfen Lied).

They are all horrible misexperimental-like creatures; Ryzel has one monster/claw-like hand and a blade where her hand should be (read: Slayers from The Suffering). Their legs are inverted and they have claws as feet. Kischkel is the only Angel Creep missing a wing, so he is very suseptible to getting owned because he only has one left.
