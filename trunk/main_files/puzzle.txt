Allen's dream

1st puzzle: the 3 little pigs

There are holes in the walls of each of the 'pigs.' You will be allotted a certain amount of time for each tanagram, and if you fail the tanagram, a random one will replace that one and you will have to start and rearrange the pieces to fit all over again.

Once upon a time there were three little pigs.
Their mum told them to build a house strong enough to shelter their entire family.
The little pigs argued and argued until they decided to each build their own house.
But then the bad wolf came to eat them all.
Does he?
