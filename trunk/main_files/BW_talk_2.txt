=]
Reed says:

Reed says:
=]
Reed says:
anni
Reed says:
you're sooooo dirty <3
Anni says:
<_<
Anni says:
lies
Reed says:
ok the
Reed says:
then*
Reed says:
IM DIRTY
Reed says:
>=)
Anni says:
now that's the truth !
Reed says:
8D!!
Anni says:
hum
Anni says:
I was wondering
Anni says:
how would tenko finally find out that felix is the serial killer =S ?
Reed says:
yeah
Reed says:
hm
Reed says:
AH
Reed says:
i know
Anni says:
?!
Reed says:
tenko read in the reports that the scent of motorcycle smoke could be felt shortly after each muder
Reed says:
murder*
Reed says:
nah thats lame
Anni says:
hmm
Anni says:
hmmmm
Anni says:
>< i cant think
Anni says:
Well
Reed says:
masturbate, it will help you relax
Anni says:
lol
Anni says:
I'm not horny :d
Anni says:
But
Reed says:
o.o
Reed says:
its not a matter of being horny, its a matter of feeling horny
Anni says:
I was thinking maybe kooters with his pretty clever wit could piece the puzzles together.. starting with a series of little hints
Reed says:
yeah
Reed says:
since kooters is a nerd and a geek
Anni says:
well, let me give you a long explanation for something trivial x_x
Anni says:
(yes he is)
Reed says:
ok
Anni says:
i pretty much have felix's house plotted out since that's where the majority of the game takes place as a "haven"
Anni says:
once tenko lives with him his room is basically the downstairs
Reed says:
a place to rest
Reed says:
save game
Anni says:
yeah
Anni says:
entry to the upstairs part is strictly forbidden because it's a series of felix's rooms
Reed says:
i know
Reed says:
in the part where felix goes berserk
Reed says:
tenko stops by his house
Reed says:
and he thinks "my fists cant take him on alone like this"
Reed says:
which forces the player into going upstairs and grabbing a gu
Reed says:
gun*
Reed says:
with which felix can be easily taken down
Anni says:
AK-47 FTW !!
Reed says:
8D!
Reed says:
good idea huh ^^
Anni says:
yesh =] which is kinda leading to what im about to say too
Anni says:
anyways, i was thinking, to further the point, theres a door that basically leads to the hallway where the rooms are
Anni says:
it has no knobs or anything to open it and i guess it can only be opened by psychic power
Reed says:
yeah
Anni says:
...which obviously only felix can do .. to secure his privacy
Reed says:
except for the one room with a knob
Reed says:
where tenko took the gun
Anni says:
yesh
Reed says:
awesome
Anni says:
since hes not psychic lololool :p
Anni says:
so anyways
Anni says:
since after most of the "yeah were going to bed goodnight" scenes take place in felix's house, felix always goes upstairs and you never see whats beyond that door which i hope will build the players curiosity =S
Anni says:
anyways continuing from THAT...
Anni says:
why its so secret, I want it to be because that's where most of the fucked up shit he does takes place, if I can explain it that way
Anni says:
you know, blood all over the walls, random corpses for some tasty necrophilia
Anni says:
broken glass and guns and whatnot
Reed says:
i was thinking that too
Anni says:
like a total wreck scene that will freak out the player // tenko
Anni says:
yannow?
Reed says:
yeah
Reed says:
like
Reed says:
i played a game
Reed says:
where an evil spirit took over a spaceship
Reed says:
then they were looking for the ship doctor
Reed says:
blood was coming from under his bedroom door
Reed says:
and then they were all omg omg hes dead
Reed says:
it killed him
Reed says:
but after managing to open the door
Reed says:
the missing half of the crew was inside
Reed says:
blood all over the walls
Reed says:
body parts hanging sevred
Anni says:
O_O
Reed says:
and when the guy you play walks in he screams "CHRIST!"
Reed says:
tenko can do that too xD
Anni says:
haha CHRIST !! XD
Reed says:
and with a spooky BGM too
Anni says:
omg <-- has spooky bgm arsenal too
Anni says:
I want felix to live in total darkness up there
Anni says:
no windows or anything
Reed says:
we make one fuck of a developper team
Reed says:
no wait
Reed says:
boarded up windows!!
Reed says:
to give minimum visibility
Reed says:
and like
Reed says:
it tenko tries walking upstairs
Reed says:
make a scary random pic flash on the screen with a AHHHHHH sound
Reed says:
and tenko gets knocked back down
Reed says:
i hate that shit xD
Anni says:
omg that's so generic, no !! XD
Anni says:
I hate those too
Anni says:
>_>
Reed says:
the first time i fell for one i was 8
Reed says:
immagine the reaction
Anni says:
did it scar you for life?
Reed says:
i ran around the  house for 15 minutes
Reed says:
then i fell on the floor and started crying
Anni says:
T_T
Reed says:
i didnt want to move or get up
Anni says:
yeh I still get heebyjeeby scared about those too D:
Reed says:
whenever someone shows me one of those
Reed says:
i usually say
Reed says:
SON OF A BITCH
Anni says:
FUCK YOU?
Anni says:
..XD
Reed says:
then jump that person
Anni says:
excellent choice
Anni says:
damn I got so caught up in the house I Forgot what i was originally talking about...XD
Reed says:
LOL
Anni says:
*scrolls up*
Reed says:
you should so fucking play Exmortis
Reed says:
or better yet
Reed says:
the spaceship game i mentioned
Anni says:
no I googled it and i'm too scared lol
Anni says:
I'm afraid of being scared if that makes sense
Anni says:
haha
Reed says:
googled what?
Anni says:
exmortis
Reed says:
i never played 1
Reed says:
only played 2
Reed says:
it seems that exmortis 1 is a fuck load scarier than 2
Anni says:
I think I can only watch it if somebody else plays it
Anni says:
seriously
Reed says:
you get to shoot shit on 2
Anni says:
>,<
Reed says:
small gremling that throw themselves at ur face
Anni says:
wth lol
Reed says:
gremlins*
Anni says:
wth I need somebody to play exmortis with me
Anni says:
while I stand back and cling to their arm and scream at scary parts
Reed says:
count me out
Anni says:
cos I'm a pussy like that
Reed says:
unless you wanna tuck me in right after
Reed says:
or sleep beside me so i dont piss myself in fear
Anni says:
you'd have to tuck me in too @_@
Anni says:
OH
Reed says:
she remembered
Anni says:
lolol that's right.//... the serial killer
Anni says:
lol >_> yea
Anni says:
anyways what i was going to say before trailing into that long description of the house
Anni says:
there could be some event where felix had to rush out of the house and forgot to close the door
Anni says:
which leaves kooters open to exploring it
Reed says:
AH I KNOW
Reed says:
after they go to bed
Reed says:
in the morning
Reed says:
felix goes all SHIT I FORGOT I HAD TO PICK SOME STUFF UP
Reed says:
rushes out
Reed says:
and leaves the door open
Reed says:
then tenko wakes up
Reed says:
calls for him
Reed says:
nothing
Reed says:
then he explores
Reed says:
and finds the fucked up scene
Reed says:
i know a good sound effect for when he enters that precise room
Reed says:
heavy piano notes
Reed says:
those copletely fuck my sistem
Reed says:
system*
Anni says:
heavy piano notes ?_?
Anni says:
example D: ?!!
Reed says:
for example
Reed says:
cliche BGM for when a shark attacks in a movie
Reed says:
low piano notes alterning
Reed says:
something like that
Reed says:
but more
Reed says:
WHAM! SCARY!
Anni says:
oh wait
Anni says:
is it like
Anni says:
errrr fuck I wish I still had my electric keyboard x_x
Anni says:
aaa I have something in my head but i dunno if its what you are thinking of
Reed says:
try to explain?
Anni says:
the ones that creep me out are the ones that suddenly go REALLY high
Anni says:
the piano keys
Anni says:
wahh I want my piano ><
Reed says:
try a mix of very low and very high altogether
Anni says:
oh
Anni says:
is it
Anni says:
something like this ?
Anni sends:
 

Anni says:
except less uh.. bird-y
Reed says:

Anni says:

Reed says:

  Transfer of "0530.WAV" is complete.
  
Reed says:

Anni says:

Anni says:

Reed says:

Reed says:

Anni says:

Reed says:
legs and arms amputated

Anni says:
*drools*
Reed says:
