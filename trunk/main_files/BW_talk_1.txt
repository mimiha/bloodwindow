Anni says:

Reed says:

Anni says:
then put your name and pass in the fields and connect to gummi.dreamhost.com
Reed says:
ok
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
then
Reed says:
lets get started
Anni sends:
 

  
  Transfer of "BloodWindowNotes.txt" is complete.
  
Reed says:
oh god
Reed says:
the word notes
Reed says:
made me remember a game i played
Reed says:
it was based on a text parser
Reed says:
you had to write the shit u do
Reed says:
well this is a lot of shit to read
Reed says:
ima get started
Anni says:
well you dont have to read it all at once
Anni says:
lol
Reed says:
dont worry
Reed says:
im a fast reader
Reed says:
*reads first sentence then falls into a coma*
Reed says:
powerful stuff.
Reed says:
ah
Reed says:
so the connection between felix and chloe
Reed says:
is the eye
Anni says:
yea
Anni says:
did you actually get the acct from vinic ?
Reed says:
no, i registered like 2 months ago
Reed says:
and it said they hated me and fucking banned me
Anni says:
lol
Anni says:
oh
Reed says:
i logged in just now
Anni says:
then you cant use the ftp
Reed says:
and its operational
Anni says:
you need to get hosting service from specifically vinic
Reed says:
i see.
Reed says:
but vinic was last seen 2160 mins ago
Reed says:
hm
Reed says:
less than 2 days
Anni says:
thing is i doubt he'll give you the acct on hosting
Anni says:
since it's really only availble to lardpirates ;/
Reed says:
i c
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
hmm
Reed says:
can u tell me whats the game format=
Reed says:
something like pokemon?
Reed says:
or more like zelda?
Anni says:
Hmm
Anni says:
Out of battle is like valkyie profile
Reed says:
uh o.o
Anni says:
In battle is just platform
Anni says:
it's all platform
Anni says:
all of it
Reed says:
dunno what that is
Reed says:
soooo
Reed says:
like super mario?
Anni says:
yea
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
thats not very fun
Reed says:
in case it would be like pokemon, u should use a prog called rpg maker
Reed says:
you can load the sprites urself
Reed says:
create skills, attacks
Reed says:
etc
Anni says:
well
Anni says:
if you played valkyrie profile
Anni says:
youd understand better
Reed says:
ok then
Anni says:
it isnt like super mario in terms of anything except just platforming ><
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
people will see it like maplestory
Reed says:
:\
Reed says:
unless ur planning on going 3d
Anni says:
well screw them
Reed says:
lol
Reed says:
nice
Anni says:
there's no 'grind'
Reed says:
everyone is the same level
Reed says:
except bosses will have to take more shots to b killed
Reed says:
right?
Anni says:
what do you mean
Anni says:
http://img96.imageshack.us/img96/6232/untitleduy3.jpg and this is VP
Reed says:
the combat parts of the game
Reed says:
ah.
Anni says:
well not everybody is the same level
Anni says:
you could just use tenko for the entire game
Anni says:
except youre just pretty fucked when it comes to the point where you HAVE to use felix in a battle 8D but whatever
Anni says:
if you mean that
Anni says:
and the damage isn't going to be noob when you first start
Anni says:
not going to deal like 20's
Anni says:
you're going to deal in the 100's
Anni says:
and just keeps getting progressively bigger because i like big numbers
Anni says:
tenko's super damage attack can do like 2 million at level 40
Anni says:
lloloolol
Reed says:
LOL
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
like you usually say
Reed says:
"thats just messed up."
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
naming the skills is the most xD part
Reed says:
i once played a game where one of the skills was called impact slot
Reed says:
xDDDDDDDD
Anni says:
o_O
Reed says:
waterline
Reed says:
is that the sewer?
Reed says:
the towns water supply?
Anni says:
hospital
Reed says:
ahhh
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
im reading the part where felix and the bishop have a nice talk
Reed says:
i dunno why
Reed says:
but i see a part of the game take part in a n acqueduct
Reed says:
in an*
Anni says:
o_o
Reed says:
ooh
Reed says:
i think im gonna piss myself laughing
Reed says:
when i see the bookcase fall on the guy
Reed says:
xDDD
Anni says:
YES
Anni says:
LOL
Anni says:
i was thinking that too
Reed says:
xDDDD
Anni says:
ahhahfshahsfds when I wrote that I was like HAHAHHAHa oh man im gonna get a kick out of this
Reed says:
tee hee
Reed says:
damn, we're gonna laugh making this thing xD
Reed says:
a lot
Anni says:
INDEED
Reed says:
a wall of diamonds
Reed says:
lol, thats a fuckwad thought
Reed says:
typical of tenko
Anni says:
durrr
Reed says:
LOL
Reed says:
vomits in pain
Reed says:
tears off the bishops limbs
Reed says:
this is gonna be R rated
Reed says:
violence, more violence
Reed says:
the only thing left here is porn
Anni says:
none of that
Anni says:
lol
Anni says:
=.=
Reed says:
aw.
Reed says:
damn this is pretty messed up
Reed says:
you're gonna have a fuckload of work ahead
Anni says:
=[
Reed says:
this is prolly 3 months+ work
Anni says:
=]
Reed says:
and it seems like the game will be pretty big
Anni says:
The thing is
Anni says:
(ill probably split the game up in 2 parts to fix that)
Anni says:
but
Anni says:
I really need a background designer
Anni says:
honest to god
Reed says:
hmm
Anni says:
I'm fucked without one
Reed says:
i know one
Anni says:
who pwns at scenery ?

Reed says:
cya
Anni says:
were you speaking portugese =S ?
Reed says:
yes, we were
Anni says:
zzzzzzzzz
Anni says:
I see
Reed says:
wait, you herectic
im outta here, ashole
WAIT....ahhh fuck he's gone
Reed says:
LOL
Anni says:
8D
Reed says:
you got fantastic ideas
Anni says:
Oh
Anni says:
not sure if this is in the txt file or not
Anni says:
but if you look in felix's eyes you get side effects =p
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
it says here
Reed says:
tenko is thinking why does he barf when he tries to eye contact with felix
Reed says:
wow
Reed says:
so this game is basically
Reed says:
chase felix
Reed says:
ask him whats going on
Reed says:
prevent them both from getting killed
Reed says:
then killing felix to avoid world destruction
Anni says:
lawl
Anni says:
not really
Anni says:
jsut the first part is sorta slow with the chasehimchasehimchasehim
Reed says:
have you idea on where u gonna get BGMs?
Anni says:
got em already
Reed says:
cool!
Reed says:
have u got a BGM for those "omg, he's around here somewhere and im about to get a huge scare" moments'
Reed says:
?
Anni says:
yep silent hill OST ftw 8D
Reed says:
omg
Reed says:
if u wanna get real scares
Reed says:
play eXmortis
Anni says:
buh?
Reed says:
this doesnt look like an adventure game
Reed says:
its plain terror
Reed says:
if this proves to give me nightmares or scares, im not gonna play it to the end xD
Anni says:
@_@
Anni says:
well
Anni says:
In the beginning
Anni says:
I was actually going to make it something like silent hill
Anni says:
but then I figured
Anni says:
Nah, make it a game where you beat the shit out of like 3 monsters on the screen with 1 skill, huge numbers,lots of BAM BAM BAM
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
make it challenging
Reed says:
if youre planning on making the kills easy
Reed says:
then make stuff like puzzles
Anni says:
well
Reed says:
for example
Anni says:
the first part of the game is always easy
Reed says:
some room in waterline has a locked door
Reed says:
and u have to get keycards
Reed says:
oir figure out a code
Anni says:
but later on i'm going to try to make puzzles or monsters thatmake you want to break your computer
Anni says:
lol
Anni says:
Like in valkyrie profile there's this one dungeon
Anni says:
Whenever you enter or exit a room, that room turns 90 degrees
Anni says:
It's REALLY REALLY hard
Reed says:
i was thinking about the same thing lol
Reed says:
but im thinking of a puzzle of the sort
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
its taken from a quest in runescape
Reed says:
but its pretty intelligent
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
its basically a dungeon with 3 floors
Reed says:
and small indents on the walls
Reed says:
which contain lenses
Reed says:
and differnetly colored crystals
Reed says:
with the 7 colors of the rainbow
Reed says:
basically
Reed says:
first you have to remove some ceiling blockage
Reed says:
so that the light may come in
Reed says:
then u have to install the lenses and cristals properly
Reed says:
so that white light (the misture of all 7 colors) hits to a specific place
Reed says:
and opens a door
Anni says:
sounds crazily hard
Reed says:
oh yeah
Reed says:
i tried doing it without walkthoughs
Reed says:
stood up a whole night
Anni says:
woow
Anni says:
well
Anni says:
I've been playing alundra, i'll get some good ideas from that
Anni says:
alundra is one of the hardest puzzle games ever ><
Reed says:
and my other idea
Reed says:
is a part where tenko and felix are surrounded
Reed says:
then tenko gets KO'd and felix gets taken
Reed says:
its like one of those fights in final fantasy
Reed says:
where you have to lose the fight on purpose
Anni says:
oh those
Anni says:
LOL I hate those
Reed says:
and then felix is tied to a bed
Anni says:
I always use items
Anni says:
I HATE THAT HAHAHa
Anni says:
Go on
Reed says:
and they are planning on removing the blood window from him
Reed says:
so like
Reed says:
the doctor with the scalpel approaches him
Reed says:
and anesthetizes him
Reed says:
and then a part of the game is on felix's dream
Reed says:
where he remembers shit gone by, something to make the story even deeper
Reed says:
and then a flight of stairs
Anni says:
THEN RUOFL POPS OUT AND KICKS THE DOCTORS ASS
Reed says:
and he goes up
Anni says:
@#*!#@!
Anni says:
lol, go on
Reed says:
finds a translucid-like sprite
Reed says:
someone he held dear
Reed says:
and he is like "oimg, ur here i cant believe it"
Reed says:
and the person is like "you must wake up, your time has come to rise"
Reed says:
and then he does that
Reed says:
POPS OUT
Reed says:
AND WHAM
Reed says:
gunshots everywhere
Reed says:
and blood
Reed says:
and guts
Reed says:
etc etc
Reed says:
and then to make it funny
Reed says:
felix looks around
Reed says:
laughs
Reed says:
and leaves the room with a "how cliche"
Anni says:
8D!!!!!!
Anni says:
thats a keeper
Anni says:
*clips to notes section*
Reed says:
thanks :D
Reed says:
and i thoguth you were gonna hate my ideas
Reed says:
xD
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
it just ocrurred to me
Reed says:
that the translucid sprite
Reed says:
(ghostly=
Reed says:
could be felix himself
Reed says:
but with both eyes intact
Reed says:
and then felix would say
Reed says:
"are you me? am i you?
Anni says:
"YES BIZZATCH! Hurry up and wake up so we both don't die ): "
Anni says:
... lol
Reed says:
do you like it=
Reed says:
xD
Anni says:
mmhmmms
Reed says:
yays
Reed says:
*back to reading*
Anni says:
Oh yeah
Anni says:
after the last BEGIN SCRIPT
Anni says:
the storyline is pretty jumbled because those were my pre-thoughts
Anni says:
the parts with BEGIN SCRIPT are my well thought out ones ;p
Reed says:
we need to cut the stuff thats not needed
Anni says:
Dunno if that makes sense
Reed says:
first
Reed says:
lets just add good shit to the notes section
Anni says:
kk
Reed says:
after we think up the final part
Reed says:
we clean the bad parts
Anni says:
kayyy
Reed says:
and make the storyline clear
Reed says:
after thats taken care of
Reed says:
we can make the game map
Reed says:
wats cutscenes, whats not
Anni says:
=
Anni says:
=] !!!!
Anni says:
best storyline partner ever!
Reed says:
thanks :$
Reed says:
umm
Reed says:
btw
Reed says:
are there more characters than the current ones?
Reed says:
because some spaces are blanked out
Anni says:
?
Reed says:
om your site
Reed says:
on*
Anni says:
Oh
Anni says:
yeah
Anni says:
It's just that I didn't create a portrait for them yet
Anni says:
I still don't know what the doctor is going to look like ._.
Reed says:
hmm
Reed says:
i have an idea for that
Anni says:
I keep thinking a cross between alex and oyarsa but that'll look so gay so ionno ><
Reed says:
make a basic male middle aged face profile
Reed says:
and just fill it with one color
Reed says:
make it mysterious
Reed says:
or....
Reed says:
uh
Reed says:
i have an idea
Reed says:
this is gonna sound hell stupid
Reed says:
but my dad reminds me of hospitals 
Reed says:
you could make him look like him
Reed says:
xDDDD
Anni says:
XD take a picture of your dad ;o
Reed says:
i got one around here
Reed says:
hope the scanner aint fucked
Anni says:
I'll just make him look menacing and evil
Reed says:
yeah
Anni says:
..LIKE VILLAINS ARE SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE
Reed says:
LOL
Reed says:
i wish one of the chars looked like me, that would be kickass xD
Anni says:
well I could make one like you since i only have names and personalities down for most of them ;/
Reed says:
o.o
Reed says:
awsum
Reed says:
so
Reed says:
which chars are faceless yet'
Reed says:
prepare an information txt for me while i look for the pic
Reed says:
ill be here sitting looking for it
Reed says:
or just type it here, ill keep track of it xD
Reed says:
AHH SHIT
Reed says:

Reed says:
gross
Anni says:
sorry sorry
Anni says:
I was
Anni says:
watching the part in snakes on a plane
Anni says:
where sam says the motherfucking snakes line
Reed says:
Lol
Anni says:
OK
Anni says:
UHHHH
Anni says:
WELL
Anni says:
I need to put more random people in the hisatsu gang
Anni says:
I already have illu covered
Anni says:
THATS PRETTY MUCH ALL I CAN THINK OF ATM
Reed says:
hmm
Reed says:
a part of the game
Reed says:
where theres a turf war
Anni says:
yeah
Anni says:
lots of them i was thinking
Reed says:
awesome
Anni says:
;o
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
since you made eouen one of the heads of hisatsu
Anni says:
Sort of like Suikoden battles ;o
Reed says:
you could place my face somewhere in ullu
Reed says:

Anni says:
HOKAY
Reed says:
so, am i gonna be the face of strafey or something? xDDD
Anni says:

Reed says:

Reed says:

Anni says:

Reed says:
o.o
Reed says:
xD
Reed says:
eouen's portrait makes her look like someone's scratching her back LOL
Anni says:

Anni says:
Supposed to be showing her pierced tongue
Anni says:
but you can barely see it
Anni says:
in that thumbnail
Reed says:
does she look like that irl? xD
Anni says:
I dunno but I know she has red (not the red in the pic) hair and she's pretty
Anni says:
that's about it
Reed says:
ah i can see the piercing
Reed says:
hell, i cant find that pic <_<
Anni says:

Reed says:

Reed says:

Reed says:
i hate that pic, but the others are worse
Anni says:
nah nothing wrong with it
Reed says:
8D
Reed says:
"Listen, nutjob, it's kinda impossible to get rid of this 'THING' without DYING. FURTHERMORE, it's not MY fault the church is a bunch of greedy fuckwads. It's YOUR fault for joining the corrupt little shits. If you came here to call me names then get the fuck out of my house! Nobody invited you anyway!"
	Tenko grabs Felix by the collar.
"Then stay out of this. This is my problem now. You think you can take ahold of a situation which isn't even yours?"
	Felix opens his mouth to say something, but doesnt. Tenko puts him down.
"I must destroy the corrupt officials that still survive... I will start with Waterline. I must protect people from any of their horrible schemes. Goodbye. Thank you for the information."
	Tenko is about to walk out but Felix calls to him.
"Wait a sec..." Felix mumbles. "You're telling me you're going in there all alone?"
"I don't need you."
"Hmph!"
Reed says:
see that part?
Reed says:
right before felix says I must destroy etc etc
Anni says:
hm?
Reed says:
tenko should also say "without dying? what could it be then???"
Anni says:
tenko says that part
Anni says:
not felix
Reed says:
and then felix show the eye
Reed says:
and then put the patch back on
Reed says:
its just an idea
Reed says:
ah
Reed says:
ok
Anni says:
sorry if i confuse =p
Reed says:
nah
Reed says:
its clear now
Anni says:
he wouldn't dare try to protect all those people at this point, lol
Anni says:
he's the serial killer if it wasnt obvious ;p
Reed says:
awww he stays with felix how sweet
Reed says:
tenko is the killer???
Anni says:
nooo felix
Anni says:
XD
Reed says:
oh
Reed says:
but why the girls with the stomachs?
Anni says:
well
Anni says:
its a thing with the chloe partly in his brain
Anni says:
since she particularly wasnt pretty
Anni says:
she thinks pretty girls shouldnt have a right to show off their beautifulness
Anni says:
so he kills them out of jealousy ;p
Reed says:
ah
Reed says:
hmm
Reed says:
i hav an idea
Reed says:
like, after the whole big waterline part
Reed says:
hmm
Reed says:
not that
Reed says:
maybe
Reed says:
that first waterline part
Reed says:
should only involve a small part of the building
Reed says:
like, tenko only trashes a few stuff
Reed says:
and then he spots another book called notes
Reed says:
and they mention something about some place just outside town
Reed says:
and then when they go back to felix's house and sleep
Reed says:
tenko hears some noises that wake him up
Reed says:
and finds felix talking to himself
Reed says:
but his voice seems to shift between a male voice and a female voice
Reed says:
manifestations of chloe 8D
Reed says:
and then tenko forces felix to talk about his past
Anni says:
which part
Reed says:
what do you think? *starts to back away in fear of total rejection*
Anni says:
er which part this after ?
Reed says:
let me make it clearer
Reed says:
when tenko is thinking of blowing waterline
Reed says:
he goes there
Reed says:
but only to the first few parts of the building
Reed says:
the rest of the parts can be used in the story later on
Reed says:
e.g the part where felix gets tied up and they try to poke his eye ou
Reed says:
out*
Anni says:
oh the one at night?
Reed says:
yeah
Anni says:
ah
Reed says:
and then when they come back to felix's house
Reed says:
that chloe thing happens
Anni says:
well, my thoughts are, it sounds good but i didnt really want to reveal the entire chloe/ruofl merging thing until way later
Reed says:
ah
Reed says:
then nvm
Anni says:
Though
Reed says:
yes?
Anni says:
i think the earliest he talks in the girl voice is when they go to the illu HQ to talk to oya
Anni says:
then tenko freaks out like whut
Anni says:
but yea
Reed says:
hmm
Anni says:
Uhh I was gonna say something but I forgot
Anni says:
damn ><
Anni says:
But
Reed says:
then forget that waking up in the middle of the night part
Anni says:
I don't want it till later because once felix finds that he never really lived through the entire past that's imbedded in his mind, he'll start to freak out
Anni says:
I mean how would YOU feel if you found out your life is a lie =s
Reed says:
yeah
Reed says:
and when felix does freak out
Reed says:
he tries to kill everyone
Reed says:
and then tenko finds felix through a trail of corpses
Reed says:
and theres a battle against him
Reed says:
after which felix falls unconscious and when he wakes up hes less insane
Anni says:
yes yes
Anni says:
THEN THERE HAS TO BE SOME COMFORTING SCENE BETWEEN FELIX AND TENKO
Anni says:
cos thats hot
Anni says:
ANYWAYS
Anni says:
DAMN
Anni says:
I forget 
Anni says:
oh yeah
Reed says:
o.o
Reed says:
hmm im seeing here that after felix and tenko go to waterline they dont get out of therem they get tied up
Anni says:
For now until he finds out he's a fake, he'll just regard the female voice like "just a thing", like when your voice cracks
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
two choices
Reed says:
do you prefer them tied up
Reed says:
or leave the waterline safely and confronting the doctor later on?
Anni says:
Hmmm
Anni says:
Well
Anni says:
HMMM
Anni says:
HMMMMm
Anni says:
What do you suggest
Reed says:
i think we can put more important stuff in
Reed says:
if they leave safely
Anni says:
kay, what shall they do in there then?
Reed says:
we need a wake up in the middle of the night scene tho
Reed says:
those are hot
Anni says:
8D
Anni says:
Then they have mad sweaty mansex
Anni says:
BUT UH YEAH
Reed says:
uhh
Anni says:
we need one of those
Reed says:
thats
Reed says:
disgusting
Anni says:
lawl
Anni says:
you know im jk ;o
Reed says:
lets just make them kiss
Reed says:
ONCE
Anni says:
ONCE
Anni says:
@*#@(!!
Anni says:
NO MAN
Anni says:
They should kiss WHEN THEYRE BOTH DUDES
Anni says:
HA HA HAHA
Reed says:
and that will happen when felix is being taken over by chloe
Anni says:
THEN THEY FREAK OUT AND THINK THEYRE GAY
Reed says:
like she's all "i never had a real boyfriend" and she kisses tenko
Reed says:
YEAH
Reed says:
I HAVE AN IDEA
Reed says:
after the whole
Reed says:
felix is insane i must knock him down fight
Reed says:
felix wakes up less insane
Reed says:
but in some point
Reed says:
he gets taken over by chloe 
Reed says:
and knocks tenko
Reed says:
out
Anni says:
THEN HAS MAD SWEATY BRAINSEX
Anni says:
Omg omg I have an idea after you say yours
Reed says:
and then tenko wakes up tied to a torture rack
Reed says:
and chloe tortures tenko
Reed says:
and then maybe u have to press a button repeteadly to whitstand the torture xD
Reed says:
and then she kisses him and gets back to her old felix self
Reed says:
now please, do tell your idea
Anni says:
OH YES
Anni says:
UH ONE SEC
Anni says:
I forgot when I was petting ym dog
Anni says:
gimme a second >>
Reed says:
LOL
Reed says:
"ha..uh..mmmmurr." Felix wakes up. he looks around "Where's this?"
"My top priority was getting you out before that doctor did something nasty to you. It seems they're really after you, badly."
"Buh?"
"He gave you something that made you sleep... so I saved you, but just now a bunch of people from the hospital came and ripped your house to shreds, looking for you. I ran straight to this alley and watched them from afar... I brought your motorcycle since you seem to like it a lot."
"Oh, my Alice. You saved her, thanks..."
"..."
	Pause.
"Will you tell me why they want you so badly? Why do they call you Astral Carrier? Could you be ?E?E?E"
"..."
	Pause.
"...Are you blind?"
".....Aaah, noono, my left eye... well, it's missing, ha ha."
Reed says:
if they leave safely we have to cut off this part
Reed says:
because for that felix tied up ting to happen he must still have hiseye
Reed says:
8D
Anni says:
well he does
Anni says:
he's just lying about it
Reed says:
oh
Reed says:
xD
Reed says:
these notes are pretty messed up in some parts
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
after we agree on everything
Anni says:
sorry ahahha
Reed says:
we gonna make it clearer
Anni says:
we'll make it better if we just work together
Anni says:
=]
Reed says:
yeah
Reed says:
it would be easy if we lived near each other, its easier to discuss shit sitting in front of each other in a table drinking ice tea
Reed says:
than tiring out fingers out in this crappy program
Anni says:
DAMN YEA
Anni says:
Pay for ticket to america plox
Reed says:
8D
Reed says:
what state?
Anni says:
ILLINOIS
Anni says:
OH YEAH
Anni says:
my idea
Anni says:
I just remembered it now
Anni says:
LIKE
Reed says:
type it before u forget it
Anni says:
So like
Anni says:
When they visit Oya, kooters officially becomes felix's "guardian angel" which felix redeems as fucking retarded but kooters seems to believe oya, who already knows kooters has special eyes too (SINCE HES SMART)
Anni says:
AND
Reed says:
oo
Reed says:
AH
Anni says:
Their "base" officially moves from felix's house to felix's room in the illu HQ
Anni says:
So
Reed says:
TENKOS SPECIAL EYES = resistance to the side effects?
Reed says:
answer after u write out everything
Anni says:
kk lol was about to explain that xD but
Reed says:
>.<
Anni says:
Kooters talks to one of the illu people and they warn him to watch out for felix XD
Anni says:
If she starts asking to "tell her stuff" then he's in trouble if he falls asleep
Reed says:
lols
Anni says:
So he's wondering well what the fuck does that mean
Anni says:
THEN LATER she asks him to "tell her stuff" so he's like OH SHIT. What do I do
Reed says:
scary
Anni says:
So he just does and then he falls asleep, then in the middle of the night
Anni says:
He wakes up tied to his bed and felix about to chainsaw his legs off 8DDDDDdddd
Reed says:
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
Anni says:
WHICH IS A SIGN OF APPRECIATION TO HER
Anni says:
Because I actually do that when I like somebod
Anni says:
y
Reed says:
thats just fucked up
Anni says:
I ask them to tell me stuff >>
Anni says:
BUT THAT'S BEYOND THE POINT
Reed says:
erm
Anni says:
So yeah that was my idea
Reed says:
if we actually meet irl
Reed says:
dont ask me to tell you stuf
Reed says:
i dont wanna wake up with you chainsawing my legs
Anni says:
8D
Reed says:
the idea of that possibility makes me want to kill you before you do it to me
Anni says:
=[
Anni says:
take pics of my corpse
Reed says:
id never hurt you tho <3
Anni says:
anyways, about what you said earlier
Anni says:
everybody has the special power with their eyes ;o and it happens to everybody, like nobody is immune to felix's sickness inducing eyecontact and nobody can resist kooters' warm fuzzy feeling eyes
Reed says:
o.o
Reed says:
LOL
Anni says:
if that makes any sense at all
Reed says:
nope
Reed says:
it doesnt
Anni says:
HMM
Reed says:
i might go to the USA
Anni says:
o:
Reed says:
if you promise not to kill me
Anni says:
i promise ;o
Anni says:
if I did then my storyline would be fucked forever ):
Reed says:
or to remove any part of my body
Anni says:
just dont mind me cha--oh
Anni says:
nevermind what i was about to say
Anni says:
<<
Reed says:
cha wha?
Reed says:
oh
Reed says:
chaIINSAW
Reed says:
<_<
Anni says:
>>
Anni says:
my brother gave me a chainsaw for my birthday
Anni says:
=s
Reed says:
omg
Reed says:
damn you aidan.
Anni says:
<<
Reed says:
if i do stay in the couch
Reed says:
im locking the living room door
Reed says:
i dont want any surprises
Anni says:
<_<
Reed says:
except waking up with you on me
Reed says:
that would be hawt
Reed says:
8D
Anni says:
>_>
Reed says:
back to reading the story line
Reed says:
=)
Anni says:
=]
Reed says:
(mental note: do not hit on her. disasttrous effects. world destruction. must make coffee.)
Anni says:
n___________________________________________________________n
Reed says:
there
Reed says:
finished reading the notes
Reed says:
just reading the bonuses
Reed says:
there
Reed says:
done reading
Reed says:
lots of incomplete stuff
Anni says:
^_____^
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
what id rly like to do now
Reed says:
is to discuss the turf wars
Anni says:
kk
Reed says:
like
Reed says:
you shouldnt just have the option of staying neutral or joining illu
Reed says:
you can also join hisatsu, keeping contact with illu
Reed says:
but your real intention is to fuck hisatsu
Reed says:
but to not make it too easy
Reed says:
free repairs, etc from hisatsu are a LIE
Reed says:
everything must be paid
Reed says:
free stuff = illu only
Reed says:
of course hisatsu will blow your cover and all of them will turn aggro on you
Anni says:
owned !
Reed says:
but your life will be spared because eouen said so
Reed says:
theres gonna be a series of fights first tho
Reed says:
like
Reed says:
first u gotta kill 3 hisatsu gangstas
Reed says:
then 4
Reed says:
then 5
Reed says:
up to 10
Reed says:
or make the max fight 15
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
the point of this part
Reed says:
is to lose
Reed says:
and in case someone manages to get through all the fights
Reed says:
eouen will still say "let him go"
Reed says:
but when u get kicked off
Reed says:
you mysteriously find a key in your pocket
Reed says:
it will be used later on to open a chest in felix's room that contains the best weapon for tenko
Reed says:
8D
Anni says:
lol *wonders why felix would have a knuckle in his room*
Anni says:
sounds good so far, but
Reed says:
hmm
Reed says:
then place the chest in the illu wep storage
Reed says:
8D
Anni says:
will you only be able to join 1 or is joinin hisatsu completely necessary
Anni says:
bc, if you can only join 1 for the rest of the game it kinda sucks that you have to pick only that or else you cant get the best weapon
Reed says:
then
Reed says:
lets make it dual
Reed says:
choose hisatsu = wep for tenko
Reed says:
choose illu = wep for felix
Reed says:
and in case people want both
Reed says:
a new game plus option isnt a bad idea
Anni says:
*shudder*
Reed says:
but that can be discussed later on
Anni says:
new game +
Anni says:
alright
Reed says:
dont u know what new game + is? o.o
Anni says:
no it just seems like a whore to proram
Anni says:
program
Reed says:
oh
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
not rly
Reed says:
you only get to keep the items u got from new game 1
Reed says:
all the skills
Reed says:
exp
Reed says:
that shit
Reed says:
is resetted back to 0
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
onto items/skills
Anni says:
I have this bitchin idea for items
Reed says:
just one thing first
Reed says:
i dont think that a repair system is necessary
Reed says:
it will just give you more trouble
Anni says:
zzzz boooo
Anni says:
alright
Reed says:
but if you want to do it
Reed says:
im not keeping you
Reed says:
im just a second hand opinion here
Anni says:
nah if you say it's bad i'll pitch it
Anni says:
might get annoying after awhile anyways
Reed says:
yeah...
Reed says:
have you thought what to name the game currency?
Reed says:
i thought of Cash
Reed says:
xD
Anni says:
just money
Anni says:
dollars
Anni says:
whatever
Anni says:
since its not really in a fantasy continent of Mcflargenblargen
Reed says:
o.o
Reed says:
LOL
Reed says:
ok then
Reed says:
dollars
Reed says:
well then
Reed says:
for the equips
Reed says:
will it be individual parts like
Reed says:
earrings, rings, pendants, helm, gloves, boots. suit, weapon,shield?
Anni says:
yeah
Reed says:
thats bitching
Reed says:
but its coool
Anni says:
well
Reed says:
and offers more versatility
Anni says:
i dont want it to be like
Anni says:
OK YOU NEED
Anni says:
THIS SUIT BUY IT FROM SHOP NOW IT HAS THIS RESISTANCE SO YOU NEED TO USE IT
Reed says:
LOL
Anni says:
I wanted it to be kinda more like ROSE
Reed says:
you use what u want
Anni says:
like random stuff you find has random stats on it ;o
Reed says:
tenko can use
Reed says:
shield knuckle
or
knuckle knuckle?
Reed says:
dual knuckles...lol.-
Anni says:
both of them only have two weapons
Anni says:
kooters dual knuckle or handgun
felix dual dagger or dual machinegun
Anni says:
apart fromt he skills anyway
Anni says:
i was thinking of giving felix a rocketlauncher but that's a little extreme lol
Reed says:
that could be the so called best wep for felix
Reed says:
8D
Anni says:
bitchin'
Reed says:
hmm
Reed says:
and also there should be another bonus
Reed says:
that unlocks the chainsaw 
Reed says:
(D
Reed says:
8D*
Anni says:
8DDDD chainsaw
Reed says:
cool huh
Anni says:
im gonna kill myself with all these sprites tho
Anni says:
lol
Reed says:
im typing a whole lot of shit here
Reed says:
xD
Anni says:
oh yeah and i want it to be kinda like an mmorpg. you get stat points and you can add them in whatever stats you want to mold your chara into + a variety of skills.. like if you want felix to be a bitchin dagger user only then you can do just that ;o
Reed says:
Felix
Buffing skills:
Inject acid: Increases speed, attack, defense, but decreases movement speed for 30 seconds
Enrage: Increases attack power severely for 10 secs
Cliche: Makes enemies feel stupid and run away (10% success)

Attack skills:
Rapid round: 10 shots are shot on a single target
Triggerhappy: Bullets flyf off hitting all enemies
Suffer: Shoot what the hell is around, even if its an ally.
Reed says:

Anni says:
har har suffer is the name of my muse 8D
Reed says:
Slice'n'dice: Hits an enemy several times with a dagger
Blades dance: hits several enemeis with a dagger
Obliteration: Severely hit 3 random targets with a dagger
Reed says:
if you got more skill ideas, or comments on my own, please do point out :P
Anni says:

Anni says:
that reminds me
Reed says:
yes
Anni says:
do you want to see my current skill list so far
Reed says:

Reed says:
8D
Anni says:

Anni says:

Anni says:

Anni sends:
 

Reed says:

Reed
age: 23
A weaponcrafter and drug dealer. he supplies felix with his beloved drugs and also is responsible for his armament. they met back in the gang days where they were both part of the same gang. reed sees felix as a brother, but that doesnt keep him from charging high prices in exchange for his services to him.
  
  Transfer of "BloodWindow Effects.txt" is complete.
  
Reed says:
hmm
Reed says:
what are these books for?
Anni says:
omg you bastard, changing me high drug prices >:0
Anni says:
oh theyre in the illu library in game
Reed says:
LOL
Reed says:
hmm
Reed says:
maybe there should be a part in which u gotta choose a book
Reed says:
and then u get a different item for each book u choose
Reed says:
but not weapons or anything
Reed says:
stuff like jewelry
Reed says:
ill read the books and make up that shit
Reed says:
and like, when felix is in a place with no shops at all
Reed says:
there is an option to use a cell phone
Reed says:
and then i teleport there and sell shit
Reed says:
with high prices
Reed says:
xD
Anni says:
BASTARDD
Reed says:

Reed says:
8D
Reed says:
love me.
Anni says:

Reed says:
but if its a summon to places with no shops
Reed says:
it should be expensiver
Reed says:
as a way of penalty
Reed says:
can you make me wear cool clothes =D
Reed says:
like a metal chestplate, boots and gloves
Reed says:
and my arms and legs are in bandages

Reed says:

Anni says:

Reed says:
aha
Reed says:
got the book part
Reed says:
items for it
Anni says:
O RLY?!?!
Reed says:
Choosing a book:
Dying earth: ring of ruofl: +30 defense, but hp decreases over time due to decadence
Bed of thorns: ring of cress: +15 skill attack power, constant poisoning while equipped
Ragnarok: Ring of tirth: +45 attack, but causes berserk (loss of control, the character just keeps attacking)
Ancient Moon: Ring of arnia: +30 intelligence, decreased defense
Spring: Ring of lysto: constant hp regeneration, but as your hp recovers, the other stats decrease

Anni says:
mm
Anni says:
sounds good
Reed says:
8D
Reed says:
what is ruofl's curse?
Reed says:
SHOTGUN-
Instantly kills Felix to trigger Ruofl's Curse.
Though it isn't 100%, the chance is raised from 50% to 80%.
Max level 1.
Anni says:
its when felix turns into the zombie
Reed says:
ah
Reed says:
have you ever watched medabots?
Anni says:
nope
Reed says:
well
Reed says:
some skills are starter ones
Reed says:
and when u lvl up
Reed says:
u get 5 skill points
Reed says:
to advance your skills
Reed says:
as u advance in the game
Reed says:
u get more skills
Reed says:
is that it?
Anni says:
hum i guess
Anni says:
i wanted to put some skills in types of b ranches
Anni says:
like in RO, a shield cru would use all of the spells in the Shield skill branch
Reed says:
like a triggering macro?
Anni says:
?_?
Reed says:
like in flyff, the skill bar
Reed says:
im not understanding what ur saying
Anni says:
like....
Reed says:
*conf00zled*
Anni says:
ok like in rose
Anni says:
a muse can either go attacking branch so that they become mage
Anni says:
or healing spell branch to become cleric
Reed says:
AHHHH
Anni says:
or they can go to the summoning branch so they get phantom swords, firegon, elementals etc
Anni says:
you know?
Reed says:
now i understand
Reed says:
kinda much like taking different builds in flyff for different 2nd classes X_X
Reed says:
well that skill branch thing will pretty much eliminate the need for the Gemini skill
Anni says:
well thats only for stats, the skills are different since you dont need skill points to learn them
Anni says:
not really
Anni says:
a male felix who is complete 100% psychic damage inclined
Anni says:
will never be good as a complete 100% psychic damage female
Anni says:
and vice versa with a dagger female
Anni says:
if that makes sense
Reed says:
ah
Reed says:
well then
Reed says:
felix starts off as a bandit, and then depending on what skills he chooses, dagger or gun, he can either become a Blade Junkie or a Gun Nut xD
Reed says:
for tenko......
Anni says:
pretty much
Reed says:
knuckle skills = High Psephis
handgun skills = Fallen Psephis
Anni says:
well unless player has some really high +accuracy equips
Anni says:
handgun is designed to suck
Anni says:
since kooters' accuracy is low with a gun and its prett ymuch his only means of long range
Anni says:
but i digress
Reed says:
well, people have tastes.
Anni says:
yeah
Reed says:
argh, the registrations for rose should open by now
Reed says:
i cant believe their lazy enuff not to delete a few inactive accs
Anni says:
zzz yea but oh well its the only pserver out there for rose and i bet like everybody plays
Reed says:

Reed says:

Reed says:

Reed says:

Reed says:

Anni says:

Anni says:
nobody can use a shield
Reed says:
OH
Reed says:

Anni says:
and yea batkine
Reed says:

Anni says:

Reed says:

Reed says:

Reed says:

Anni says:

Anni says:

Anni says:
I JUST LOVE DRAMATIC PARTS
Anni says:
go on tell tell
Reed says:
its a part where u have to enter a dungeon
Reed says:
make out this complicated puzzle
Reed says:
and then u go down and discover a secret medical facility
Reed says:
you go in
Reed says:
bust everyone
Reed says:
then in the last room u find felix dead, and the blood window removed
Reed says:
then tenko is "NOOOOOOOOO! they'll pay for this"
Reed says:
and then u take felix's corpse
Reed says:
then the screen blackens
Reed says:
and everyone in the illu is in felix's room, with him on his bed
Reed says:
then tenko goes out seeking who did it
Reed says:
and he heads back to waterline
Reed says:
he accesses the previously locked parts
Reed says:
oh wait. NO
Anni says:
NO? o o
Reed says:
its the other way around
Reed says:
his eye gets taken in waterline
Reed says:
and then tenk heads out to the dungeon
Reed says:
tenko*
Reed says:
because the weird fucked up ritual is there xD
Reed says:
tenko gets there in time
Reed says:
fights ruofl
Reed says:
after the fight ruofl teleports away
Reed says:
tenko takes the blood window
Reed says:
heads back to illu
Reed says:
pops felix's eye back in
Reed says:
and felix comes back
Anni says:
well
Anni says:
the thing is felix doesnt die when he loses the bw
Anni says:
o:
Reed says:
the drama in this part is "omg...i dunno if i can keep playing, the poor guy is dead"
Reed says:
then lets make it a coma
Reed says:
8D
Anni says:
okay 8D
Reed says:
because they didnt just take the window
Reed says:
